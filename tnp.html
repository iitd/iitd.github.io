<h1>Internships</h1>
<h2>DURATION, VENUE, RETURN DATE</h2>
<!--Internships should last for at least 40 working days for you to get COT credits; <b>however for 2021, a minimum duration of 30 days is required to claim the internship</b>.--> The internships should start on or after 15th May 2023. You should ideally do the internship at the premises of the company or university concerned. <!--Given the recent COVID19 situation, remote internships are also acceptable.-->  You are expected to finish your internship and be back on campus on or before 21th July 2023. No exceptions will be allowed.  Further, if you have any TA duties, any re-major exams, or any hostel requirements to report to the IITD campus earlier than 21st July, it is your responsibility to arrive earlier than 21st.

<h2>INTERNSHIP DIARIES</h2>
Those of you doing summer internships (for COT credit) should email Ms. Manju a brief update (few paragraphs) of your work every two weeks from the start of your internships.  Ms. Manju's email address is listed below.  For your training diary, you can simply put together the content of your emails to Ms. Manju and treat that as your diary. <!--You must also attach the following form to the diary:<br>
<a href=https://tnp.iitd.ac.in/newtnp/TrainingFrontPage.pdf>https://tnp.iitd.ac.in/newtnp/TrainingFrontPage.pdf</a>-->

Those who are signing non-disclosure agreements with companies can leave out details from the email updates which violate the NDAs, but should still send updates with some information about the work they are doing.

<h2>NGU REGISTRATION</h2>
You should have already initiated approval of your COT course on the NGU website (for both self-arranged internships and internships via TnP) <a href=https://ngu.iitd.ac.in/index>https://ngu.iitd.ac.in/index</a>. Do so ASAP if not already done. You can list Prof. Sorav Bansal (TnP coordinator for CSE department) as your faculty supervisor. 

<h2>AFFILIATION ON RESEARCH PAPERS</h2>
Any research papers published with you as a co-author from your internship work should list your affiliation as "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, I.I.T. Delhi, Hauz Khas, New Delhi - 110016, INDIA".
