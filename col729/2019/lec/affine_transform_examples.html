<h3>Minor variants of examples in Figure 11.35</h3>

<p>Re-indexing example with order/dependencies between s1 and s2 reversed
<pre>
for (i = 1; i &lt;=N; i++) {
  X[i] = Y[i - 1];  //s1
  Y[i] = Z[i];  //s2
}
</pre>

The processor mapping obtained for this example will be the same as our re-indexing example:
<pre>
s1: p = i - 1
s2: p = i
</pre>

The transformed code becomes:
<pre>
if (N &gt;= 1) X[1] = Y[0];
for (p = 1; p &lt;= N-1; p++) {
  for (i = 1; i &lt;=N; i++) {
    if (p == i - 1) {
      X[i] = Y[i - 1]; //s1
    }
    if (p == i) {
      Y[i] = Z[i]; //s2
    }
  }
}
if (N &gt;=1) Y[N] = Z[N];
</pre>
The iteration space interval for s1 is [p+1,p+1] while the iteration space interval for s2 is [p,p]. Both are disjoint and
so there are only two sub-intervals, with the second sub-interval occuring before the first sub-interval. We get:
<pre>
if (N &gt;= 1) X[1] = Y[0];
for (p = 1; p &lt;= N-1; p++) {
  Y[p] = Z[p]; //s2
  X[p + 1] = Y[p]; //s1
}
if (N &gt;=1) Y[N] = Z[N];
</pre>
Hence, the re-ordering happens when we split the intervals into sub-intervals and <em>order</em> them based on their precedence order.

<h3>Reasoning about spatial locality in this framework</h3>
Consider the permutation example. If the array Z is stored in row-major format, then this transformation will change the
access pattern and could potentially be worse than the original code (even though it improves temporal locality).

<p>To model spatial locality, recall that we approximate a whole row (last index in case of row-major) as a single element.
In this case, to do this, we would transform the original code into something like the following:
<pre>
for (i = 1; i &lt;=N; i++) {
  for (j = 0; j &lt;=M; j++) {
    tmp = Read Z[i]
    tmp = Modify(tmp, Z[i-1]);
    Z[i] = Write tmp
  }
}
</pre>
We consider the entire row Z[i] as a single element, and perform a read-modify-write operation on it. Now, if we construct
the dependencies, we see that different iterations of the inner loop are also dependent on each other (because they are
accessing the common "element" Z[i]). This means that the dependency is in both dimensions i and j, and hence there is
no parallelism, and the loop nest is left unchanged.

Notice that if we consider Z to be column-major and then reason about spatial locality in this example, we would end up
interchanging the loops as before.
