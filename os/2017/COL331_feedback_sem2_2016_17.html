<strong>Q. No. 1 : What did you like the most about this course?</strong> (Responses: 50)<br><br>1. Content  structured teaching  assignments  homeworks<br>2. Very interested about the subject<br>3. The teaching was very organised as it is a huge and a vast topic<br>4.
 I liked the fact that everything was so organised and  that the Video 
lectures and all the material was so readily available  All we need to 
do is just go and study that  I wish every professor in IIT was as good 
as Bansal Sir  <br>5. Well planned course  instructor had deep knowledge<br>6. Very well structured and mot rushed<br>7. The availabilty of video lectures<br>8. Everything was explained beautifully <br>9. na<br>10. Already planned everything  and video lectures <br>11. We learnt a lot about what goes into making an OS  it was fun <br>12. good<br>13. every think was organized <br>14. The teaching the very good  The course pattern was good <br>15. taught very well  <br>16. Though being a hardware course  the instructor taught it so well and logically that it became one of my favorite course <br>17.
 I am in awe of the instructor  Very clear and crisp structure  Lecture 
Videos are a blissful respite  Also lots of scope for creative thought <br>18. Subject<br>19. Lectures<br>20. There were full video lectures of the course available<br>21. Really systematic course with stress on understanding of concepts<br>22. Video Lectures  Nice teacher<br>23. The way it was taken  Very well organized and content was great <br>24. The lectures were delivered in a quite nice way <br>25. Labs  Concurrency<br>26. No opinion<br>27. Everything<br>28. Video lectures<br>29. way of teaching<br>30. Very systematic  Good resourses  Effective lecture delivery <br>31.
 The best thing I liked was that there were video lectures and the 
instructor was following them exacty in class  So if I had any doubt  I 
could watch the video lectures  This also helped me understand some 
concepts which I couldn t learn in one go <br>32. everything<br>33. the delivery of lectures<br>34. Nice professor<br>35.
 I am highly inspired by the way of teaching in this course  Lecturer is
 so clear in his explanations that he doesn t need to rephrase his words
 again unlike other teachers  Assignments were in great synchrony with 
the course contents   <br>36. By far the most interesting and the best 
taught course in my IIT course work  The instructor does an excellent 
job at explaining things but I think he already knows that  Truly glad 
to have had the opportunity to study under him <br>37. The Professor s 
way of teaching  He explained difficult concepts in a way that made them
 look effortless and intuitive  The course was well structured and 
planned out <br>38. n<br>39. Best Instructor ever  Creating first process was really cool  Labs were good too <br>40. Concepts were taught well and the prof worked hard for us to learn<br>41. Good course<br>42. The teaching was simply amazing <br>43. teaching<br>44. Effective course materials<br>45. Too light work load of the course <br>46. This is the best course in IIT  Havn t seen such organised and exhaustive course <br>47. NA<br>48. The content was amazing  Very logical and interesting  It was a great help to have lecture videos <br>49. No Attendence Policy<br>50. Professor<br> <br><br>

<strong>Q. No. 2 : What did you dislike the most about this course?</strong> (Responses: 45)<br><br>1. it was boring post locking lectures<br>2. Labs could have been better  I found them boring  Really boring  <br>3. None<br>4.
 The response to questions on discussion form was not prompt or not 
given at all  It was disappointing as a student who requires help <br>5. Nothing  Every aspect was totally awesome<br>6.
 Marking scheme of exams was very random    weightage to questions was 
not uniform and grading scheme was at times ad hoc Also  better notes 
should be developed<br>7. Lots and lots and lots of theory<br>8. The pace with which lectures are taught  Too much arbitrary content <br>9. Assignments should have made compulsory <br>10. na<br>11. Some bulky assignment didn t have weightage relative to its time demand <br>12. Marking scheme was very bad <br>13. non<br>14. nothing<br>15. Nothing<br>16. NA<br>17. Exams<br>18. Nothing<br>19.
 This should float with same instructor every time so that one is not 
stuck in the last semester to complete a core course like this which is 
the heart of CS <br>20. None<br>21. No Labs<br>22. Labs<br>23. The Labs and the course contents were highly independent and different <br>24. x86 Hardware<br>25. No opinion<br>26. NA<br>27. Too much weightage for major<br>28. nothing<br>29. Major weightage should be less <br>30. no help from TA s <br>31. Many students cheated  using mobile phones and notes sharing  during examinations which disheartened me <br>32. Nothing at all <br>33. n<br>34.
 There could have been a little of a quick go through through the code 
that already existed in the assignment files during the Lab help session
 rather than telling us what to do for completing the assignment <br>35. The subject itself is boring<br>36. Too heavy course<br>37.
 The correction done by the TAs was horrible and extremely to the point 
  As discussed in the class committee meeting  The evaluation policy of 
best 2 of 3 was also not good<br>38. labs<br>39. None<br>40. Mundane teaching of Sorav Bansal  No variation whatsoever in the lectures <br>41. Nothing<br>42. NA<br>43. there was too much syllabus for majors and the exams were always very lengthy<br>44. Nothing<br>45. Nothing<br> <br><br>

<strong>Q. No. 3 : Any Suggestions or comments about the course.</strong> (Responses: 37)<br><br>1. please keep the code listing in loop during the very theoretical classes as it keeps things interesting<br>2. None<br>3. A little bit of concern towards requirements of students taking up the course an better response rate from the TA s <br>4.
 Yes  I would please request Bansal sir to show other professors at IIT 
as to how to teach courses and make material available to the students  I
 have never seen a prof  as nice as Sir  Its like Bansal sir is the only
 one who focuses on efficient teaching<br>5. Improve exam grading<br>6. Nothing really<br>7. Very nice course structure and taught beautifully <br>8. na<br>9.
 Please improve the marking scheme  lots of marks are usually cut for 
small mistakes  and many a times questions arent very clear about what 
is being expected <br>10. no<br>11. coulg give more practice question<br>12. No<br>13. NA<br>14. None<br>15. No<br>16. Regular can be helpful to students<br>17. No<br>18. No opinion<br>19. Keep it as it is <br>20. Make all labs compulsory<br>21. Best way to take such tough course like OS<br>22. Continue this prof for this course forever <br>23. Video Lectures availability also helped during the phase of the course <br>24. The lab component could be made a compulsory part of the evaluation while relieving weightage from the majors  <br>25. I don t think this course could have been taught in a better way  Professor Sorav was excellent <br>26. n<br>27.
 You can go a little faster  locks are taught in the parallel computing 
class before OS course gets there  so we could speed up that too and go 
to more advanced concepts <br>28. No<br>29. No<br>30. TAs should be more
 lenient on correction  Also  the question in the paper need to be a bit
 more clear  Evaluation policy should include both minor 1 and minor 2 
marks  along with assignments <br>31. None<br>32. Lectures could be more involving <br>33. This course is just too perfect  But the assignments should be compulsory<br>34. NA<br>35. no<br>36. No  <br>37. NA<br> <br><br>

 The last assignment for UG  Assignment 3  was fairly simple and had 
unjustified weightage compared to the first or second one <br>11. No proper guidance<br>12. Nothing<br>13. It was quite bulky<br>14.

<strong>Q. No. 5 : Any Suggestions or comments about the course</strong> (Responses: 31)<br><br>1. None<br>2. None<br>3.
 Feedback questions are such that I cannot ask to make the course less 
heavy through them  eg How much did the teacher encourage logical 
thinking  If I say  bad  means professors will increase logical thinking
  If I say excellent  means nothing to change<br>4.  None<br>5. Just fine<br>6. na<br>7. no<br>8. One of the best courses so far in IIT Delhi<br>9. NA<br>10. None<br>11. No<br>12.

Less weightage for homeworks<br>18. no<br>19. more help for LAB<br>20. The lab component could be made a compulsory part of the evaluation while relieving weightage from the majors<br>21.
