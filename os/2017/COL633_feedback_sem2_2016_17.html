<strong>Q. No. 1 : What did you like the most about this course?</strong> (Responses: 11)<br><br>1. Awesome Lectures and Great Assignments and Homework  In short Everything<br>2. everything<br>3. Well structured and informative  Gave deep insights about the working of OS <br>4. Homeworks and Assignments<br>5. Very well structured course <br>6.
 when i first studied OS  it was very basic and the real complexity 
behind such a system wasn t explained  or even touched   this course 
helped me to actually understand all of this <br>7. Professor s way of teaching<br>8. Fine structure  Very detailed discussion <br>9. The course content<br>10. learning through xv6<br>11. Use of an example OS to teach the principles of the subject  xv6 s code helped a lot to understand various concepts <br> <br><br>

<strong>Q. No. 2 : What did you dislike the most about this course?</strong> (Responses: 10)<br><br>1.
 Due to lesser speed in the beginning we had to speed up covering 
contents towards the end  though it is not a huge problem as pace was 
managable <br>2. nothing<br>3. Nothing<br>4. N A<br>5. Nothing <br>6. nothing specifically<br>7.
 Cumulative assignments   If someone is unable to do an earlier lab  its
 effect can be seen in the future labs as well  Better   Labs 
independent to each other  or if cumulative  correct solutions for the 
earlier labs are used while merging the new files<br>8. Too much trivial assignment work <br>9. Nothing<br>10. restriction of concepts taught mostly to only what are needed for xv6<br> <br><br>

<strong>Q. No. 3 : Any Suggestions or comments about the course.</strong> (Responses: 8)<br><br>1. Nothing <br>2. None<br>3. N A<br>4. All good <br>5.
 allow post grads to work in pairs  that s all   it would ve been done 
better  we already had to do more assignments and take all the exams <br>6.
 I personally liked the course very much  Earlier I had no idea about 
this field  Now I am able to understand it well  Thanks to Sorav sir    
 <br>7. None <br>8. No<br> <br><br>
