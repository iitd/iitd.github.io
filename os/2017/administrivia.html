<h3> Grading </h3>
Separate grading policy would be used for COL331 and COL633 students.

<p><b>For COL331:</b><br>
Basic Labs / Homeworks: 9 (best three out of four, 3 marks each)<br>
Minor1: 25<br>
Minor2: 25<br>
HoH Labs: 25 (4 + 10 + 11) <br>
Best two out of three among Minor1, Minor2, and HoH Labs would be considered: Best2(Minor1, Minor2, HoH Labs) = 50.<br>
Major: 41<br>
Total: 100<br><br>

<!--Doing the HoH lab assignments is optional.  -->HoH Labs must be done in groups of at most two people.  The first three parts of the HoH lab assignments carry a total of 25 marks.  If you do these three HoH lab parts, your final score will be computed using the best two out of the three (Minor1, Minor2, and HoH Labs).

<p>
Further, there are two more HoH lab parts (for a total of five), which are not a part of the course requirements. If you finish
all five HoH lab parts (with good overall performance), you will receive a letter of appreciation from the instructor and the systems research group's T-shirt.
To claim the letter and the T-shirt, the fourth and fifth parts of the HoH lab assignment must be done individually.
<!--Labs: 27 (2 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 5) <br>-->

<p><b>For COL633:</b><br>
Basic Labs / Homeworks: 6 (best three out of four, 2 marks each)<br>
Minor1: 17<br>
Minor2: 18<br>
HoH Labs: 28 (4 + 8 + 6 + 10) <br>
Major: 31<br>
Total: 100<br><br>

All five HoH labs are compulsory for COL633 registrants. The HoH labs must be done individually by COL633 students. Students finishing all five HoH lab parts with excellent performance, will receive a letter of appreciation from the instructor and the systems research group's T-shirt.<br>

<h3>Late days</h3>
<p>For HoH labs, the deadline time for a lab is 11:59pm on the deadline date.
You will be allowed a total
of <em>10 free late days</em> (across all HoH lab assignments). i.e.,
you can submit your assignment late without penalty provided you
stay within your budget of late days. After you exceed your budget
of free late days, you will be penalized at the rate of 1 mark per
day. i.e., if your assignment had a weight of 5 and you
have a late day penalty of 2 marks, you will be evaluated out of
3 for that assignment. The late
penalty for any single assignment will never exceed 3 marks. If you
submit late, you are responsible for scheduling your demo with the
TA. If you are unable to schedule your demo, your submission will
not be counted. The accounting of late days will be done at the granularity
of one hour.

We will provide enough time for you to work on your
assignments and advise you to use these late days judiciously to cover
unforeseen/emergency situations. <i>No other request for deadline extension
will be entertained</i>

<p>Exams will be open book, open notes. You must bring with you
the <code>xv6</code> code listing to the exams as questions
may be asked on it.

<p>To know your current score in the course, logon to
<code>palasi.cse.iitd.ac.in</code> and type <code>os-score</code><br>

<p>Audit criteria: equivalent to B- or above.<br>

<p>
Attendance requirements: as per institute norms


<h3>Regrading Policy</h3>
If you are dissatisfied with your grade in any of the homeworks,
lab-evaluations, or exams, you can submit it for regrading.
You should give us a written
note explaining which question(s) you think were incorrectly evaluated
and why you think so, along with your corrected manuscript. If we find
merit in your concerns, we will address them. On the other hand, if we
find your regrading request to be frivolous, you will incur a penalty
of 1 mark (this has to be done to reduce frivolous requests, which we
find are many).
Your regrading request for an assignment should be received within
15 calendar days of the return of answer scripts.

<p>Also, if you ask us to regrade a submission, we can regrade other
questions (apart from the one that you point out) in that submission too.

<h3>Academic Integrity Code</h3>
<b>Academic honesty is required in all your work</b>. Verbal discussion of
assignments is fine but looking at someone else's work and then doing your is
not. You must do all written and programming assignments on your own, except
where group work is explicitly authorised. If you have performed your work
after verbal discussions with others, please explicitly
indicate so in your submission. This is important, as otherwise any undue similarity
would be treated with suspicion.

If you use parts of a solution or code from other
sources (such as Internet, other OSes, etc.), you should explicitly mention it in your
submission. <b>Letting your work become available
  or visible to others is also cheating</b>. The first instance of cheating will
straight-away invite an 'F' grade in the course and a referral to the disciplinary committee.
