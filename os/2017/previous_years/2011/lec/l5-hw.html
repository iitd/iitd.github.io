<h1>Homework: Processes, Interrupts, Exceptions, Context Switch</h1>

<p>
<b>Hand-In Procedure</b>
<p>
You are to turn in this homework at the beginning of lecture.
Please write up your answers to the exercises below and hand them in to a
staff member at the beginning of the lecture. <b>Write your CSE login ID at
	the top of your submission</b>
<p>

<h3>Assignment Part 1 (Zombies)</h3>
In UNIX, a child process may terminate before a parent calls
<code>wait()</code>. When the parent calls <code>wait()</code> eventually,
it still expects to read the correct exitcode that the child returned.
To support this functionality, UNIX does not completely remove the process
till it's parent has called <code>wait()</code> on it.

<p>
Such processes that have completed execution but still have an entry
in the process table are called <em>zombie processes</em>. Usually,
the presence of zombie processes in the system for a long time indicates
a bug in the program (it is a common error).

<p>
Read about Zombie process at this <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_process>wikipedia article</a>. Also read about the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIGCHLD>SIGCHLD</a> signal.

<p>
<b>Turn in:</b><br>
In class we discussed that the shell implements "<code>&</code>" functionality
by not calling <code>wait()</code> immediately. Should the shell
never call <code>wait()</code>? When should it call
<code>wait()</code>? Answer by providing short pseudo-code.

<h3>Assignment Part 2 (memory and processes in xv6)</h3>

<p>
Be sure you have read <a href="../xv6-book/mem.pdf">xv6 chapter 2</a>
and familiarized yourself with the xv6 code it refers to before lecture.

<p>
Use QEMU with GDB to trace through the free list creation
and memory allocation process described in the first part of the chapter.
Make sure you understand how the C pointer arithmetic
in <code>kfree</code>'s <code>for</code> loop works:
especially the relationship between the
<samp>rp</samp>, <samp>r</samp>, and <samp>p</samp> variables.

<p>
Also step through
the creation of the first process by <code>allocproc()</code>,
and then step through the first context switch <i>into</i> that process
via the assembly language <code>swtch()</code> code.

<p>
<b>Nothing to turn in for this part.</b>

<h3>Assignment Part 3 (traps)</h3>

<p>
<b>Read</b>: xv6
<code>trapasm.S</code>,
<code>trap.c</code>,
<code>syscall.c</code>,
<code>initcode.S</code>,
<code>usys.S</code>.
Skim
<code>vectors.pl</code>,
<code>vectors.S</code>,
<code>lapic.c</code>,
<code>ioapic.c</code>,
<code>picirq.c</code>.

<p>
<b>Introduction</b>

<p>Try to understand xv6's
<code>trapasm.S</code>,
<code>trap.c</code>,
<code>syscall.c</code>,
<code>initcode.S</code>,
<code>usys.S</code>.
Skim
<code>vectors.S</code>,
<code>lapic.c</code>,
<code>ioapic.c</code>,
<code>picirq.c</code>.
<p>
The assigned chapter (chapter 3 of xv6 book) provides a commentary for
these files, but you
may find it useful to also consult:
Chapter 5 of <a href="../ref/ia32-3.pdf">Intel's system programming
guide</a>.
Be aware
that terms such as exceptions, traps, interrupts, faults and aborts
have no standard meaning.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Turn in:</span>
In xv6, set a breakpoint at the beginning of <code>syscall()</code> to
catch the very first system call.  What values are on the stack at
this point?  Turn in the output of <code>x/37x $esp</code> at that
breakpoint with each value labeled as to what it is (e.g.,
saved <code>%ebp</code> for <code>trap</code>,
<code>trapframe.eip</code>, scratch space, etc.).
</div>

<!--
<p>
As in Homework 3, you may find it easier to examine the appropriate
stack when QEMU is simulating only one CPU instead of two.  To d
this, make a copy of Makefile called Makefile.uni, find the line that
starts with <tt>QEMUOPTS</tt>, and change <tt>-smp 2</tt> to <tt>-smp
1</tt>, and write out the file. Then run
<pre>
make -f Makefile.uni qemu-gdb
</pre>
-->

<h3>Assignment Part 4 (context switching)</h3>
<p>
<b>Read</b>: swtch.S and proc.c (focus on the code that switches
between processes, specifically <code>scheduler</code> and <code>sched</code>).
Also process creation: sys_fork() and copyproc().

<p>
In this part of the homework you will investigate how the
kernel switches between
two processes. 

<p>
<b>Assignment</b>:
<p>

Suppose a process that is running in the kernel
calls <code>sched()</code>, which ends up jumping
into <code>scheduler()</code>.

<p>
<b>Turn in</b>: 
Where is the stack that <code>sched()</code> executes on?

<p>
<b>Turn in</b>: 
Where is the stack that <code>scheduler()</code> executes on?

<p>
<b>Turn in:</b>
When <code>sched()</code> calls <code>swtch()</code>,
does that call to <code>swtch()</code> ever return? If so, when?

<p>
Now think back to <a href="../lec/l2.html">lecture 2</a> and the invariants
that gcc expects any function, including <code>swtch</code>, to
maintain.  Compare these invariants with what <code>swtch</code>
actually implements, and the state that our kernel maintains in
a <code>struct context</code>.

<p>
<b>Turn in</b>: Could <code>swtch</code> do less work and still be
correct?  Could we reduce the size of a <code>struct context</code>?
Provide concrete examples if yes, or argue for why not.

<p>
Surround the call to <code>swtch()</code> in <code>scheduler()</code> with calls
to <code>cprintf()</code> like this:
<pre>
  cprintf("a");
  swtch(&cpu->scheduler, &proc->context);
  cprintf("b");
</pre>
<p>
Similarly,
surround the call to <code>swtch()</code> in <code>sched()</code> with calls
to <code>cprintf()</code> like this:

<pre>
  cprintf("c");
  swtch(&proc->context, cpu->scheduler);
  cprintf("d");
</pre>
<p>
Rebuild your kernel and boot it on QEMU.
With a few exceptions
you should see a regular four-character pattern repeated over and over.

<p>
<b>Turn in</b>: What is the four-character pattern?

<p>
<b>Turn in</b>: The very first characters are <code>ac</code>. Why does
this happen?


<h3>Assignment Part 5 (bootsector) : OPTIONAL</h3>
This part of the assignment is optional. i.e., this part of the assignment
carries no marks. It is just here to give you more insight into the bootsector
code. You may choose to skip this part.

<p>A bootsector is only 512 bytes which is a very short space to be able to
fit any useful code. So typically a bootsector loads another "program"
from disk and jumps to it. For example, the bootsector might load
the bootloader code (e.g., GRUB, LILO) and jump to it. The bootloader, in
turn, loads the actual OS.

<p>xv6 bootsector contains a very simple IDE disk device driver to read
the sectors from disk. An IDE disk has a very simple interface and hence
it is possible to fit a device driver inside the bootsector. But what if
the boot device (containing the bootloader and the kernel) was a CDROM,
SCSI disk, USB disk, etc. All these devices have much more complex
interfaces and it will be hard (if not impossible) to fit their device
drivers in a bootsector. So how does the OS boot from these devices?

<p>The answer is that BIOS helps in the boot process. BIOS supports
certain "BIOS functions" that the bootsector (or bootloader) can
call. Some examples of the functionality supported by these
functions are: get the physical memory size, read the <em>n</em>th sector
of the boot device, etc. This functionality is exposed using the
interrupt interface and the <b>int</b> instruction (similar to how
system calls are handled on 32-bit linux).

Pintos is an OS that is capable of booting through a USB device. You
can try booting your personal computer using pintos by using the
following command:
<pre>
pintos --hardware --</pre>
This will create a disk image called <code>os.dsk</code>. You can
write this disk image to your USB device using:
<pre>
dd if=os.dsk of=/dev/sdb</pre>
assuming your USB disk is at <code>/dev/sdb</code>.

<p>Skim through information on "BIOS Interrupt calls" on Wikipedia <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS_interrupt_call>here</a>, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INT_10H>here</a>
and <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INT_13H>here</a>.

<p><b>Turn in:</b><br>
Look
at Pintos bootsector code and list all the BIOS
interrupt calls used by Pintos and their corresponding functionality.

<p>
<b>This completes the homework.</b>
