<h1>Context switching</h1>

<p>Required reading: proc.c (focus on scheduler() and sched()), swtch.S.
Also process creation: sys_fork() and copyproc().

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Big picture: more programs than CPUs.  How to share the
limited number of CPUs among the programs?

<p>Idea: have the kernel transparently switch the CPU(s) among
programs, giving them a "virtual CPU" abstraction.

<p>Terminology: I'm going to call a switch from one program to
another a <i>context switch</i>.

<h3>The program's view of context switching</h3>

For this discussion we're going to assume that the O/S runs each
program in a "process", which couples an address space with a single
thread of control.  For the most part each process appears to have a
dedicated CPU, but if processes compare notes they can see that the CPU
is actually multiplexed, with this process-visible behavior:

<ul>
<li>When a process makes a system call that blocks, the kernel
arranges to take the CPU away and run a different process.
For example, if read() needs to wait for the hard disk to
finish reading a block, the kernel will cause a different
process to run until the disk has finished.
<li>The kernel time-slices the CPU among processes that
compute a lot.
<li>Both of the above are largely transparent to the process,
in the sense that the kernel resumes a process with the
same register and memory state it had when the kernel suspended it.
(Except that a system call may explicitly modify state required
to express its return value or data read by e.g. read().)
</ul>

<p>The kernel also exposes system calls for handling
processes; here are the main XV6 process system calls:
<ul>
<li>fork: create a new process, which is a copy of the parent
<li>exec: execute a program file
<li>exit: terminate the calling process
<li>wait: wait for a child process to call exit
<li>kill: kill process
<li>sbrk: grow the address space of a process.
</ul>

<h3>The kernel's view of context switching</h3>

As you know, the xv6 kernel maintains a kernel stack for each process,
on which to run system calls for the process. At any given time,
multiple processes may be executing system calls inside the kernel.
This is a common kernel arrangement -- multiple threads of control in
the kernel address space, one per user-level process.  A kernel thread
must be capable of suspending and giving the CPU away, because the
implementation of many system calls involves blocking to wait for
I/O. That's the reason why each xv6 process has its own kernel stack.

<p>Terminology: if a process has entered the kernel, the kernel stack
and CPU registers of the resulting thread of control is called the
processes <i>kernel thread</i>.

<p>
In this arrangment, the kernel doesn't directly switch CPUs
among processes. Instead, the kernel has a number of mechanisms
which combine to switch among processes:

<ul>
<li>User->kernel transitions, which we've seen when we looked at
system calls and interrrupts.
If a process is running and makes a user->kernel
transition, we're then running in the process's kernel thread.
This transition saves the state of the
user process -- saving its register in a <tt>struct trapframe</tt>
on the process's kernel stack. A user->kernel transition
initializes fresh register state for the process's kernel thread.
<li>Switching between kernel threads. If a kernel thread calls
sched() or yield() or sleep(), the kernel saves that kernel
thread's registers, picks another runnable kernel thread, and
restores its registers  -- restoring ESP and EIP cause a
stack switch and control switch.
scheduler() also switches user segments; this has no immediate effect,
it only affects what happens on a future return from kernel to user.
<li>Kernel->user transitions. A return to user space restores
the user registers from the trapframe, and implicitly loses
the register state of the process's kernel thread.
<li>Timer interrupts. The timer interrupt handler implements
time-slicing by calling yield(). At a low level yield() only
switches between kernel threads, but the interrupt may have caused
a user->kernel transition, so the net effect is often to
switch between user processes.
</ul>

<p>
Processes can be in a number of states (see proc.h):
UNUSED, EMBRYO, SLEEPING, RUNNABLE, RUNNING, ZOMBIE.

sys_fork.  why save pid in a temp variable? [1883]

<h3>xv6 code examples</h3>

Let's watch what happens when a timer interrupt causes an
involuntary context switch between two compute-bound user
processes. The user process:

<pre>
main(){
  fork();
  while(1)
    ;
}
</pre>

<p>
Run bochs with a single CPU (<tt>bochs -q -f uni</tt>, then
<tt>load-symbols "kernel.sym"</tt>).
Break in yield(), then print stack using <tt>x/16x $esp</tt>
on kernel stack of one of the processes,
The return EIP should be trap(). <!--(but might be alltraps; why?)-->

<p>
Why does yield() need to acquire proc_table_lock? [1973]
When will the lock be released?

<p>
Why state = RUNNABLE? What was state's previous value?

<p>
yield() calls sched() which calls swtch()
<tt>b "swtch", s, c, print stack</tt>.
Look at definition of struct context: it's a set of saved registers.
swtch() will save into one context, restore from another.
What are the two contexts?
<tt>x/8x</tt> the context addrs.

<p>
Where do we think swtch() will return to?

<p>
Why doesn't swtch() save EAX in struct context?

<p>
At end of swtch(), what stack are we running on?

<p>
Where does print-stack show swtch() will return to? Why did
this happen?

<p>
scheduler() is in the middle of a loop that checks to see whether
each process would like to run (is RUNNABLE).

<p>
If scheduler() finds no RUNNABLE process, it finishes the
loop, releases the lock, but then immediately re-acquires
the lock at the start of the outer loop.  Why release
just to re-acquire?

<p>
That is, suppose for a while there are no RUNNABLE processes.
What will the CPUs spend their time doing?

<p>
Why do we need to disable interrupts while holding locks in the kernel?
For example, why do we disable interrupts when grabbing a lock,
e.g. in scheduler?
or tickslock in sys_sleep, trap?

<p>If we always had enough idle processes, we could avoid having
to release the lock.

<p>
On the other hand, what would happen if we never enabled interrupts
in scheduler() and kept spinning with no processes to run?

<p>
How does the scheduler avoid picking the same process that just
called yield (if there's another process that can run)?

<p>
scheduler() has its own stack (in cpus[x]). Why? Why not just
call it directly from sched()? I.e. why not have scheduler()
run on the stack of the last process that gave up the CPU?
Because the scheduler() on a multiprocessor system may need
to release the ptable lock. And the parent of an exiting process
might deallocate it's child stack. So if the scheduler was
running on the child's stack at that time, we have a problem.
Hence, scheduler needs a separate stack. Could idle processes
make this possible? yes, because in that case the scheduler
does not need to release the lock (in some sense, we are using
the idle process's stack).
<br>
- On an SMP, scheduler may have to release ptable lock<br>
- If a ptable lock is released, it is possible that the old process's stack
gets deallocated (if it had just called exit)<br>
- Hence the scheduler must run on a different stack from old process's stack.


<p>
What policy does scheduler() use to give CPU time to processes?

<p>
We know scheduler() is going to run the other cpu-bound process,
by calling usegment() and swtch() to restore other process's registers
and stack.   Why does it set state to RUNNING?  (That is, what's the
functional difference between RUNNABLE and RUNNING?)

<p>
Do we need to call usegment in scheduler?  Can we call it just
before returning to user-space instead?  What does usegment do
exactly (set stack-top, user segments)?

<p>
Break in swtch() again, and check that we are indeed switching
to the other process's stack, and step through to the return
from its call to yield() from trap().

<p>
Break in swtch() a few times to see that we're bouncing between
two processes (based on their context address values).

<p>
How do we garbage-collect processes in xv6?  Can't deallocate
the stack we're running on right now.  When does a process get
deallocated?  Back to process state diagram, ZOMBIE state.
Why does exit pass children to init, rather than to its own parent?

<p>
How do we kill a process?  Why not turn it into a ZOMBIE directly?

<h3>Wrap-up</h3>

More sophisticated operating systems usually allow multiple threads of
control in a process. How could we do this for xv6? Each thread would
have its own user-space stack in the process address space. There
would be a few more system calls: perhaps thread_fork(),
thread_exit(), and thread_wait(). The kernel would have to split
<tt>struct proc</tt> into a structure describing overall process
resources (address space and open files), and a kernel stack and set
of saved registers per thread. That way multiple threads from a
process could be executing system calls inside the kernel.

<p>
How would a context switch between threads differ from a context
switch between processes?

<p>
Added complication with kernel threads: concurrent syscalls?

<p>
We could also implement threads in user-space (maybe even pre-emptive
with a periodic interrupt like SIGALRM).
What's the difference?
What do we gain from kernel threads?

<!--
<p>
It's worth comparing xv6's fairly conventional context switches with
those of JOS.  JOS has only one thread active in the kernel at a time,
and thus only a single kernel stack (not one per process) and no
thread switching inside the kernel. It only has an analogue to xv6's
kernel entry/exit to save/restore user thread state. But as a direct
consequence JOS 1) can't run the kernel concurrently on multiple CPUs
and 2) cannot have system calls that block in the middle (e.g. to look
up a multi-component path name).

<p>
What would look different in JOS's implementation of scheduling,
interrupts?  What's the equivalent of swtch()?
-->

<p>
We've seen the complete story of how xv6 switches between user
processes. This is the concrete realization of the virtual CPU
abstraction. The core mechanism is swtch(), which saves and restores
thread register state and thus switches stacks (ESP) and changes the
control flow (EIP). We also saw a bit of what it takes to integrate
thread switching with the concurrency brought by multiple CPUs and by
interrupts.
