<h1>Scheduling Policies</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<ul>

<li>What is scheduling?
    <ul>
	<li>OS policies and mechanisms to allocate resources to entities.
	<li>Usually in the context of resources where re-assignment
	    can happen with some frequency: CPU cycles, network
	    bandwidth, disk accesses, memory when swapping to disk.
	<li>Not so applicable to more static resources like disk space.
	<li>Entities that you might want to give resources to: users,
	processes, threads, web requests.<!--, or MIT accounts-->

	<p>

	<li>Scheduling unavoidable with shared resources (whether implicit
	    or explicit), but particularly interesting when demand exceeds
	    available resources (e.g. demand for CPU is infinite with
	    compute-bound tasks).
	<li>A good scheduling policy ensures that the most important
	    entity gets the resources it needs.
	<li>Many polices for resource to entity allocation are possible:
	    strict priority, divide equally, shortest job first, minimum
	    guarantee combined with admission control.

	<p>

	<li>This topic was popular in the days of time sharing, when
	    there was a shortage of resources all around.
	<li>Many scheduling problems become not very interesting when
	    you can just buy a faster CPU or a faster network.
	<li>Exception: web sites and large-scale networks often cannot
	    be made fast enough to handle peak demand (flash crowds,
	    attacks) so scheduling becomes important again.
	    For example may want to prioritize paying customers, or
	    address denial-of-service attacks.
	<li>Exception 2: some scheduling decisions have non-linear
	    effects on overall system behavior, not just different
	    performance for different users.  For example today's paper.
    </ul>

<li>Key problems
    <ul>
	<li>Gap between desired policy and available mechanism.
	    High-level desired policies often don't have a one-to-one
	    mapping onto available scheduling mechanisms.  Scheduler
	    can approximate policy, or implement it under certain
	    assumptions, etc.

	<li>Conflicting goals, e.g. low latency, high throughput,
	    and fairness.  The scheduler must make a trade-off between
	    the goals.

	<li>Interaction between different schedulers.
	    Just optimizing the CPU scheduler may do little to for
	    the overall desired policy.
    </ul>

<li>General plan for scheduling mechanisms
    <ol>
	<li>Understand where scheduling is occuring.
	<li>Expose scheduling decisions, allow control.
	<li>Account for resource consumption, to allow intelligent control.
    </ol>

<li>Round-robin: equal time for all environments:
    <ul>
			<!--
	<li>Reading between the lines, equal time for all environments:
	    JOS's mechanism is that the 10 msec timer time-slices in
	    round-robin among all runnable environments.
			-->

	<li>But this only works if processes are compute-bound.
	    What if a process gives up some of its 10 ms to wait
	    for input?  Do we have to keep track of that and give
	    it back?

	<li>For a long time Linux had a similar problem, where a
	    process can use CPU time "undetected" by yielding just
	    before the 10ms timer interrupt.

	<li>How long should the quantum be?  is 10 msec the right answer?
	    Shorter quantum will lead to better interactive performance,
	    but lowers overall system throughput because we will reschedule
	    more, which has overhead.

	<li>What if the environment computes for 1 msec and sends an IPC to
	    a server environment?  Shouldn't the server get more CPU time
	    because it operates on behalf of all other functions?

	<li>Potential improvements over pure round-robin: track "recent" CPU use
	    (e.g., over the last second) and always run environment to
	    which we "owe" the most CPU time. (But can't accumulate CPU
	    debt forever...)

	<li>Other solution: directed yield; specify on the yield to which
	    environment you are donating the remainder of the quantum
	    (e.g., to an IPC server so that it can compute on the
	    environment's behalf).
    </ul>

<li>Pitfall: Priority Inversion
    <ul>
	<li>Assume policy is strict priority.<br>
	    Thread T1: low priority
	    (e.g. check to see if I have new mail periodically).<br>
	    Thread T2: medium priority.<br>
	    Thread T3: high priority (e.g. real-time game).
	<li>T1: acquire(l)<br>
	    context switch to T3 (maybe T3 wakes up needs to run:
	    it has priority)<br>
	    T3: acquire(l)... must wait for T1 to release(l)...<br>
	    context switch to T2 (again, perhaps T2 needs to run &
	    has prio over T1)<br>
	    T2 computes for a while<br>
	    T3 is indefinitely delayed despite high priority
	<li>Can solve if T3 lends its priority to holder of lock
	    it is waiting for, so T1 runs instead of T2.
	<li>This is really a multiple scheduler problem,
	    since locks schedule access to locked resource.
	<li>(Diagram.)
    </ul>

<li>Pitfall: Efficiency and conflicting requirements.
    <ul>
	<li>Efficiency often conflicts with fairness, or any other policy.
	<li>Long time quantum for efficiency in CPU scheduling
	    versus low delay and context-switching overhead.
	<li>Shortest seek versus FIFO disk scheduling.
	<li>Contiguous read-ahead vs data needed now.
	<li>For example, scheduler swaps out an idle emacs to let
	    gcc run faster with more phys mem.
	    What happens when user types a key?
	<li>These issues don't fit well into a "who gets to go next"
	    scheduler framework.
	<li>Inefficient scheduling may make <i>everybody</i> slower,
	    including high priority users.
    </ul>

<li>Pitfall: Multiple Interacting Schedulers.
    <ul>
	<li>Suppose you want your emacs to have priority over
	    everything else.  Give it high CPU priority.
	    Does that mean nothing else will run if emacs wants to run?
	<li>No: Disk scheduler might not know to favor emacs's disk I/Os.
	    Typical UNIX disk scheduler favors disk efficiency, not process
	    prio.
	<li>Suppose emacs needs more memory.  Other processes have dirty
	    pages; emacs must wait.  Disk scheduler doesn't know these other
	    processes' writes are high prio.
    </ul>

<li>Pitfall: Server Processes.
    <ul>
	<li>Suppose emacs uses X windows to display.
	    The X server must serve requests from many clients.
	<li>Does it know that emacs' requests should be given priority?
	<li>Does the OS know to raise X's priority when it is serving emacs?
	<li>Similarly for DNS, and NFS.  Does the network know to give
	    emacs's NFS requests priority?
    </ul>

<li>In short, scheduling is a system problem.
    There are many schedulers; they interact.
    The CPU scheduler is usually the easy part.
    The hardest part is system structure.
    For example, the <i>existence</i> of interrupts is bad for scheduling.
    Conflicting goals may limit effectiveness.

</ul>
