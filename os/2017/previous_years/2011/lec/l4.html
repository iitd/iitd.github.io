<h1>Processes</h1>

<p>This lecture is about the first process in xv6.

<h2>Processes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Recall the goals of processes:
<ul>
<li>Give each process a private memory area for code, data, stack.
<li>Prevent one process from reading/writing outside its address space.
<li>Allow sharing when needed.
<li>Bring a program to live
</ul>
<li>Usually the implementation is split between the O/S and the hardware.
<li>The O/S manages processes:
<ul>
<li>Allocate physical memory for them (for creation, growth, deletion).
<li>Keep track of them when they are not executing.
<li>Switch between them (to switch processes).
<li>Configure the hardware.
</ul>
<li>The hardware performs address translation and protection:
<ul>
<li>Translate user addresses to physical addresses.
<li>Detect and prevent attempts to use memory outside the address space.
<li>Allow cross-space transfers (system calls, interrupts).
</ul>
<li>Also:
<ul>
<li>O/S has its own address space.
<li>O/S must be able to conveniently read/write user memory.
</ul>
<li>Hardware support may or may not correspond well to what the O/S wants.

<li>Two main approaches: segments and page tables.  Paging has won:
most O/S are designed for paging, most modern CPU designs support only
paging. BUT x86 provides many features only via segmentation h/w
(interrupts, protection), so we must learn about x86 segments, a
little bit. Also xv6 uses segments, not paging.

</ul>

<h2>Example hardware for address spaces: x86 segments</h2>

<p>The operating system can switch the x86 to protected mode, which
supports virtual and physical addresses, and allows the O/S to set up
address spaces so that user processes can't change them.  Translation
in protected mode is as follows:
	<ul>
	<li>selector:offset (virtual / logical addr) <br>
	     ==SEGMENTATION==> 
	<li>linear address <br>
	     ==PAGING ==>
	<li>physical address
	</ul>

<p>Next lecture covers paging; now we focus on segmentation. 

<p>Protected-mode segmentation works as follows (see handout):
<ul>
<li>segment register holds segment selector
<li>selector: 13 bits of index, local vs global flag, 2-bit RPL
<li>selector indexes into global descriptor table (GDT)
<li>segment descriptor holds 32-bit base, limit, type, protection
<li>la = va + base ; assert(va < limit);
<li>choice of seg register usually implicit in instruction
<ul>
<li>ESP uses SS, EIP uses CS, others (mostly) use DS
<li>some instructions can take far addresses: 
		<ul><li><tt>ljmp $selector, $offset</tt>
		</ul>
</ul>
<li>GDT lives in memory, CPU's GDTR register points to base of GDT
<li>LGDT instruction loads GDTR
<li>you turn on protected mode by setting PE bit in CR0 register

<li>What about protection?
<ul>
  <li>instructions can only r/w/x memory reachable through seg regs
  <li>not before base, not after limit
	<li>can my program change a segment register? yes, but... to one of the
	    permitted (accessible) descriptors in the GDT
  <li>can my program re-load GDTR? no!
  <li>how does h/w know if user or kernel?
  <li>Current privilege level (CPL) is in the low 2 bits of CS
  <li>CPL=0 is privileged O/S, CPL=3 is user
  <li>why can't app modify the descriptors in the GDT? it's in memory...
  <li>what about system calls? how do they transfer to kernel?
  <li>app cannot <b>just</b> lower the CPL
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>Case study (xv6)</h2>

<p>xv6 is a reimplementation of <a href="../v6.html">Unix 6th edition</a>.
<ul>
<li>v6 is an early Unix operating system for <a href="http://www.pdp11.org/">DEC PDP11</a>
<ul>
         <li>Thompson and Ritchie, 1976
         <li>PDP11: 16 bit data and addresses, 18 bit physical addresses
         <li>ancestor of Linux &c but much smaller
         <li>recognizable: shell, multi-user, directories
         <li>written in C
         <li><a href="../reference.html">Unix papers</a>.
</ul>

<li>xv6 written for the OS course at MIT (6.828):
<ul>
         <li>even smaller than v6, maybe not useable as is
         <li>preserves basic structure (processes, files, pipes, &c)
         <li>you don't have to learn PDP11 <i>and</i> x86
	 <li>runs on multi-processor PCs.
</ul>
</ul>

<p>Newer Unixs have inherited many of the conceptual ideas even though
they added paging, networking, graphics, improve performance, etc.

<p>You will need to read most of the source code multiple times. Your
goal is to explain every line to yourself.  The chapters published
on the schedule page (by Cox, Kaashoek, and Morris) are helpful and
also required reading before the lectures!

<h3>Overview of processes in xv6</h3>

<p>In today's lecture we see how xv6 creates the kernel address
 spaces, and the first user process.  A process consists of an address
 space and one thread of control (to run the program) in xv6. The
 kernel address space is the only address space with multiple threads
 of control. We will study context switching and process management in
 detail next weeks; creation of the first user process (init) will get
 you a first flavor.

<p>The process chapter covers the material below in more detail.

<p>xv6 uses only the segmentation hardware on the x86; it doesn't use paging. 
  (In pintos you will use page-table hardware too, which we cover in
  next lecture.)
<ul>
<li>The kernel address space:
  <pre>
  the code segment runs from 0 to 2^32 and is mapped X and R
  the data segment runs from 0 to 2^32 but is mapped W (read and write).
  </pre>
<li>Each process has an address space, laid out as follows starting
at virtual address zero:
<pre>
  text
  original data and bss
  fixed-size stack
  expandable heap
</pre>
A process's code, data, and stack segments all map this virtual address
space to the same range of linear addresses. That is, all three segments
are the same.
</ul>

<p>The x86 designers probably had in mind more interesting uses of
segments. What might they have been?

<h3>xv6 process structure</h3>

<pre>
we're about to look at how the first XV6 process starts up
  it will run initcode.S, which does exec("/init")
  /init is a program that starts up a shell we can type to

what's the important state of an xv6 process?
  kernel proc[] table has an entry for each process
    p->mem points to user mem phys address
    p->kstack points to kern stack phys address
    struct context holds saved kernel registers
      EIP, ESP, EAX, &c
      for when a system call is waiting for input
  user half: user memory
    user process sees memory as starting at zero
    instructions, data, stack, expandable heap
  kernel half: kernel executing a system call for a process
    on the process's kernel stack

xv6 has two kinds of transitions
  trap + return: user->kernel, kernel->user
    system calls, interrupts, divide-by-zero, &c
    save user process state ... run in kernel ... restore state
  process switch: between kernel halves
    one process is waiting for input, run another
      or time-slicing between compute-bound processes
    save p1's kernel-half state ... restore p2's kernel-half state
  setting up first process involves manually initializing this state

saved state for trap
  during trap, the CPU:
    switches to process's kernel stack
    pushes SS, ESP, EFLAGS, CS, EIP onto kernel stack
    jumps into kernel
  kernel then pushes the other user registers
  this is struct trapframe
  trap return reverses this, resuming at saved user EIP
  for first process:
    manually set up these "saved" registers on the kernel stack
    EIP 0, ESP top of user memory, &c

saved state for process switch
  save registers (EIP, ESP, EAX, &c) in oldp->context
  restore registers from newp->context
  now we are at the EIP of newp, and using its kernel stack
  this is the only way xv6 switches among processes
    there is no direct user->user process switch
    instead, user TRAP kernel PROCESS-SWITCH kernel TRAP-RETURN user
  for first process:
    manually set up EIP and ESP to run forkret, which returns from trap
</pre>

<p>Since an xv6 process's address space is essentially a single segment,
a process's physical memory must be contiguous. So xv6 may run into
fragmentation if process sizes are a significant fraction of physical memory.

<h3>xv6 kernel address space</h3>

<p>Let's see how xv6 creates the kernel address space by tracing xv6
  from when it boots, focusing on address space management.
<ul>

<li>Start with ksegment(), which is called from main()
<li>look at GDT after lgdt with <tt>info gdt</tt>
<li>How are text, data, and stack mapped?
<li>What do the protection bits mean?
<li>How does address translation change right after lgdt completes?
  (what happened during boot?)
</ul>

<li>main() calls userinit() to create first process
<li>then scheduler() to start running processes

</ul>

<h3>creating the first process</h3>

<ul>
<li>userinit()
<li>What is in binary_initcode?
<li>How does the user stack look like?
<li>allocproc()
<li>how does the kernel stack look for the new process? what is on it?
</ul>

</ul>

<h3>running the first process</h3>

<ul>
<li>remember that main calls scheduler() after userinit()
<li>we'll see how scheduler() works in a few lectures, overview now
<li>usegment---how is the address for the user space setup?  protection?
<li>swtch
<li>forkret
<li>Which stack is the kernel using now?
<li>What is on this stack?
<li>trapret?
<li>What is on the stack?
<li>In which address space is processor after executing iret?
<li>What is on the stack in that address space?
</ul>

<p>
Timeline of a CPU: proc-switch-scheduler-switch-proc2-...

<p>swtch called by interrupt handler on behalf of the current running
process. iret may be called on the behalf of another process

<p>All switched-out processes (state=RUNNABLE) will have <code>eip</code>
value somewhere in the <code>swtch</code> function, unless they are
newly created in which case they will have <code>eip</code> pointing
to forkret. When is forkret called? (only on new process creation).
Why does it need to release the ptable lock? (how does it get released
on a regular context switch?)

<p>Each process has two halves: user and kernel. Transitions from
user to kernel: interrupts, exceptions, <code>int</code> instruction.
Transitions from kernel to user: <code>iret</code> instruction.

<p>Process switch: User->Kernel->Kernel2->User2. The switching between
user and kernel involves switching the registers and the address space.
More on address space switching later.

<p><code>trapret</code> uses <code>iret</code> instruction to return
to user mode.

<p>Question: Why can't we release the ptable lock in <code>allocproc</code>
itself? Answer: because we are not done with the PCB structure or the
PCBs themselves. We still need to keep the lock till the process has
actually started running.


<h3>Managing physical memory</h3>

<p>To create an address space we must allocate physical memory, which
  will be freed when an address space is deleted (e.g., when a user
  program terminates).  xv6 implements a first-fit memory allocator
  (see kalloc.c).

<p><tt>kalloc()</tt> maintains a list of ranges of free memory.  The
  allocator finds the first range that is larger than the amount of
  requested memory.  It splits that range in two: one range of the
  size requested and one of the remainder.  It returns the first
  range.  When memory is freed, kfree will merge ranges that are
  adjacent in memory.

<p>Under what scenarios is a first-fit memory allocator undesirable?

<h3>Growing an address space</h3>

<p>How can a user process grow its address space?  growproc.
<ul>
<li>allocate a new segment of old size plus n
<li>copy the old segment into the new (ouch!)
<li>why bother zeroing the rest?
<li>free the old physical memory
</ul>
<p>We could do a lot better if segments didn't have to be contiguous in
  physical memory. How could we arrange that? Using page tables, which
  is our next topic.  This is one place where page tables would be
  useful, but there are others too (e.g., in fork).
