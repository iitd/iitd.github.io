<!--
    notes for next year:
	- explain more clearly where the FS comes from (mkfs), which parts
	  are allocated statically (inode table, bitmaps) vs at runtime
	  (blocks).

	- set up the foray into asynchronous writes much more explicitly,
	  though perhaps discussing it in the context of xv6 will always
	  just run into non-essential aspects of xv6 design.  talk about
	  the motivation for async writes first, then think about the
	  ramifications for an OS in general?

<h1>File systems</h1>

<p>Required reading:
readi, writei, fileread, filewrite,
create, and dirlink, and code related to
these calls in fs.c, bio.c, ide.c, file.c, and sysfile.c

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The next 3 lectures are about file systems:
<ul>
<li>Basic file system implementation
<li>Naming
<li>Performance
<li>Correctness
</ul>

<p>Users desire to store their data durably, so that data survives when
the user turns off their computer.  The primary media for doing so are:
magnetic disks, flash memory, and tapes.  We focus on magnetic disks
(e.g., through the IDE interface in xv6).

<p>To allow users to remember where they stored a file, they can
assign a symbolic name to a file, which appears in a directory.

<p>The data in a file can be organized in a structured way or not.
The structured variant is often called a database.  UNIX uses the
unstructured variant: files are streams of bytes.  Any particular
structure is likely to be useful to only a small class of
applications, and other applications will have to work hard to fit
their data into one of the pre-defined structures. Besides, if you
want structure, you can easily write a user-mode library program that
imposes that format on any file.  The end-to-end argument in action.
(Databases have special requirements and support an important class of
applications, and thus have a specialized plan.)

<p>The API for a minimal file system consists of: open, read, write,
seek, close, and stat.  Dup duplicates a file descriptor. For example:
<pre>
  fd = open("x/y", O_RDWR);
  read (fd, buf, 100);
  write (fd, buf, 512);
  close (fd)
</pre>

<p>There's a couple of different things going on here.
    <ul>
	<li>Names: how do we get from the name "x/y" to the file
	    we're actually talking about.  The next lecture
	    will be all about naming.
	    Kernel interface relies on these names a lot.
	<li>Directories: provide a way of assigning user-meaningful
	    names to files.  Part of the kernel name interface.
	<li>In Unix (and almost all other filesystems) there's
	    some notion of an on-disk file that's independent
	    of the file's name, called an "inode".  Seen by the
	    user (e.g. stat) but cannot access a given inode.
	<li>Disk blocks: the inode translates offsets in our
	    conceptual file into concrete locations on disk.
	    Not seen by the user.
	<li>File descriptors: in Unix, the FD binds to the inode,
	    rather than the pathname, so the pathname lookup is
	    done only when the file is first opened.  Application
	    handle for an inode in the Unix API.
    </ul>

We're going to talk about files, blocks, and FDs today;
names and directories will be next time.

<p>Maintaining the file offset behind the read/write interface is an
  interesting design decision. The alternative is that the state of a
  read operation should be maintained by the process doing the reading
  (i.e., that the pointer should be passed as an argument to read).
  This argument is compelling in view of the UNIX fork() semantics,
  which clones a process which shares the file descriptors of its
  parent.

<p>With offsets in the file descriptor, a read by the parent of a
    shared file descriptor (e.g., stdin) changes the read pointer
    seen by the child.  This isn't always desirable: for example,
    consider a data file, in which the program seeks around and
    reads various records.  If we fork(), the child and parent
    might interfere.  On the other hand, the alternative (no
    offset in FD) would make it difficult to get
    "(echo one; echo two) > x" right.  Easy to implement
    separate-offsets if kernel provides shared-offsets
    (re-open file, mostly), but not the other way around.

<p>The file API turned out to be quite a useful abstraction.
    Unix uses it for many things that aren't just files on local disk,
    e.g. pipes, devices in /dev, network storage, etc.
    Plan9 took this further, and a few of those ideas came back to Linux,
    like the /proc filesystem.

<p>Unix API doesn't specify that the effects of write are immediately
  on the disk before a write returns. It is up to the implementation
  of the file system within certain bounds. Choices include (that
  aren't non-exclusive):

<ul>
<li>Before the write returns [most conservative, but bad for performance];
<li>Before close returns [AFS];
<li>At some point in the future, if the system stays up (e.g., after
    30 seconds) [highest performance];
<li>Application specified (e.g., before fsync returns) [requires
    careful application coding];
<li>Before external things (screen, network) indicate the write returned
    [will read paper about this later].
</ul>

<p>Some examples of file systems:
<ul>
 <li>Contiguous Allocation: <code>file a = (base=10, len=12)</code>
 <ul>
	 <li>Pro: Fast sequential access, easy random access
	 <li>Con: External Fragmentation/hard to grow files
 </ul></li>
 <li>Linked-list Allocation: <code>file = linked list of blocks
	 <ul>
		 <li>Pro: Easy to grow file. Free list can be implemented as another
		 file.</li>
		 <li>Con: Bad sequential access performance! Unreliable: Loose block, loose
		 rest of file</li>
		 <li>Serious Con: Bad random access</li>
	 </ul>
	 </li>
  <li>DOS FAT: Cute modification to linked list. Links reside in fixed
	 size File Allocation Table (FAT). Still need to do pointer chasing but
	 the entire FAT can fit in memory so chasing cheap.
	 <ul>
		 <li>Discussion (Entry size = 16 bits):
			 <ul>
				 <li>What's the maximum size of the FAT?
				 <li> Given a 512 byte block, what's the maximum size of FS?
				 <li>Option: go to bigger blocks (called "Allocation Unit Size" at
				 Format Time). Pro? Con?
			 </ul>
			 <li>Space Overhead of FAT: 2 bytes/512 byte block = approx .4%
			 <li>Reliability: create duplicate copies of FAT to protect against
			 errors
			 <li>Bootstrapping: Where is root directory? Fixed location on disk /
			 have a table in the bootsector (sector 0)
			 </li>
		 </ul>
		 </li>
		 <li>Indexed Files: Each file has an array holding all it's block pointers.
		 <ul>
			 <li>Pros: Fast random access, easy growth
			 <li>Cons: Slow sequential access, growth beyond index size clumsy. Index
			 size?
		 </ul></li>
		 <li>Multi-level Indexed Files (BSD/Unix/xv6): Direct blocks, Indirect
		 blocks, Double-indirect blocks. Caters to common case of small files.
		 Handles large files.

	 </ul>
	 </li>

<p>What makes filesystems hard/interesting?  At one level, it's much
    like any other part of an OS: trying to achieve good performance
    and provide useful functionality for lots of different applications
    with very different workload characteristics.
    However, more specifically:

<p>A design issue is the semantics of a file system operation that
  requires multiple disk writes.  In particular, what happens if the
  logical update requires writing multiple disks blocks and the power
  fails during the update?  For example, to create a new file,
  requires allocating an inode (which requires updating the list of
  free inodes on disk), writing a directory entry to record the
  allocated i-node under the name of the new file (which may require
  allocating a new block and updating the directory inode).  If the
  power fails during the operation, the list of free inodes and blocks
  may be inconsistent with the blocks and inodes in use. Again this is
  up to implementation of the file system to keep on disk data
  structures consistent:

<ul>
<li>Don't worry about it much, but use a recovery program to bring
    file system back into a consistent state.  Linux ext2 and FAT
    are such examples.  xv6 is almost in this category, except that
    it has no recovery program.

<li>Journaling state that maintains kernel invariants.
    Never let the file system metadata get into an
    inconsistent state.  In some sense, this resembles
    how the kernel deals with killing user processes:
    it cleans up kernel structures, so kernel invariants
    are upheld, but ignores application invariants.
    NTFS does this, as does Linux ext3 by default.

<li>Journaling all file system state (kernel-managed structure as
    well as user-managed data).  This tends to be quite a bit
    more expensive, in terms of performance.  Linux's ext3 has
    a full data journaling mode that behaves in this fashion.
</ul>

<p>Another design issue is the semantics are of concurrent writes to
the same data item.  What is the order of two updates that happen at
the same time? For example, two processes open the same file and write
to it.  Modern Unix operating systems allow the application to lock a
file to get exclusive access.  If file locking is not used and if the
file descriptor is shared, then the bytes of the two writes will get
into the file in some order (this happens often for log files).  If
the file descriptor is not shared, the end result is not defined. For
example, one write may overwrite the other one (e.g., if they are
writing to the same part of the file.)  Lots of other examples with
directories, names, etc.

<p>An implementation issue is performance, because writing to magnetic
disk is relatively expensive compared to computing. Three primary ways
to improve performance are: careful file system layout and data structure
design that induces few seeks (locality, btrees, logging, etc), an
in-memory cache of frequently-accessed blocks (or even prefetching),
and overlap I/O with computation so that file operations don't have
to wait until their completion and so that that the disk driver has
more data to write, which allows disk scheduling.
(We will talk about performance in detail later.)

<h2>xv6 code examples</h2>

<p>xv6 implements a minimal Unix file system interface. xv6 doesn't
pay attention to file system layout. It overlaps computation and I/O,
but doesn't do any disk scheduling.  Its cache is write-through, which
simplifies keeping on disk datastructures consistent, but is bad for
performance.

<p>On disk files are represented by an inode (struct dinode in fs.h),
and blocks.  Small files have up to 12 block addresses in their inode;
large files use files the last address in the inode as a disk address
for a block with 128 disk addresses (512/4).  The size of a file is
thus limited to 12 * 512 + 128*512 bytes.  What would you change to
support larger files? (Ans: e.g., double indirect blocks.)

<p>Directories are files with a bit of structure to them. The file
contains of records of the type struct dirent.  The entry contains the
name for a file (or directory) and its corresponding inode number.
How many files can appear in a directory?
(max file size / sizeof(struct dirent))

<p>In memory files are represented by struct inode in file.h.  What
is the role of the additional fields in struct inode (dev, inum,
refcount, flags (IBUSY, IVALID))? Why don't
    we embed dinode in the directory? (Links from multiple directories
    to the same file.)

<p>Kernel allows users to look at the inode state using stat()
or fstat(), which returns a struct stat, from stat.h.

<p>What is xv6's disk layout?  Who determines how many inodes, blocks,
  etc. (mkfs.c). How does xv6 keep track of free blocks and inodes?
  See balloc()/bfree() and ialloc()/ifree().  Is this layout a good
  one for performance?  What are other options?

	<ul>
		<li>Block 0 is unused
		<li>Block 1 is super block
		<li>Inodes start at block 2
		<li>Free-block bitmap at block <code>ninodes/IPB + 3</code>
		<li>Free blocks after that
	</ul>
	Free blocks are tracked using bitmap. Free inodes are tracked by
	linearly scanning the inode array to find one that is free.
	Other options (bitmap for inodes, better locality among inodes
	and blocks)

	<!--
<p>Let's look at:
<pre>
echo > a
echo x > a
echo < a > b
rm a
mkdir b
</pre>

<p>What file systems operations do these shell commands invoke?

<p>1rst command. Let's walk through sys_open, create, etc, skipping
  directory stuff, and look at the number of disk writes.  study
  ialloc; layout of inodes.

<p>buffer cache caches blocks containing inodes. what replacement
policy does the buffer cache implement?  (LRU, look at bget() which
traverses the list in reverse order to find a free block; brelease() adds the
block to the start of the list). what is B_BUSY? (the buffer is being
used) B_VALID? (the buffer has been loaded with disk's contents).
why does bget() panic if there's no free blocks?  (because this means
that these many threads are concurrently trying to read something off the
block, which should be a rare occasion. we expect the programmer to
release the block as soon as he is done; notice that the block still
has valid metadata and data so can be locked again if needed without
going to the disk). could we sleep? (we could).
  if the block wasn't in the cache, read it from disk - are read's
	synchronous or asynchronous? (synchronous)
	why does the ide driver need a queue? (so that many processes can
	simultaneously wait on the disk). Given that we have a queue of
	requests, what could we have done better? (process the requests using
	elevator algorithm perhaps). We are allowing only single request
	in flight to disk at a time. Modern disk controllers will allow
	many requests to be in flight and perform scheduling internally.

	<p>what does ilock(ip) after ialloc() do? (processes are only allowed
	to read and write inode metadata and contents when holding the inode's
lock).	how does ilock() implement
locks? (using icache.lock and I_BUSY flag and sleep/wakeup).
why not use a spinlock to lock an inode?  (too expensive)
why have locks? (protect against concurrent access to the same file).
  Atomic read and update.  For example, allocating an inode: read
  block containing inode, mark it allocated, and write it back.  This
	operation must be atomic (guaranteed with lock on buffer cache). 
	Are writes write-through? (yes)

<p>Returning to create, why is the update of the inode before the
update of the directory?  (to avoid dangling pointers on crash)
Can we make the disk write asynchronous? (yes)
Is there any reason to wait in ide_rw() if we're writing a block? (no,
the order of disk writes is still preserved).

<p>2nd command: write a block. bmap allocates block.  is data written
to disk? (yes) must it? (no)

<p>3rd command. read. does the read cause a disk read to happen? (no, file a's
inode and data is still in the buffer cache).

<p>4th command. unlink.  why are the old block written? (the old block is
written with the new value of nlink which has been decremented). iunlockput()
will then truncate the file using itrunc(), free the inode by setting it's
type to 0. So the old block may have to be written twice actually.)
