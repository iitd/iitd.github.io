<h1>Homework: traps, context switch</h1>

<p>
<b>Hand-In Procedure</b>
<p>
You are to turn in this homework at the beginning of lecture.
Please write up your answers to the exercises below and hand them in to a
staff member at the beginning of the lecture. <b>Write your CSE login ID at
	the top of your submission</b>
<p>

<h3>Assignment Part 1 (traps)</h3>
xv6 defines two structures that hold saved registers for a process: struct
trapframe on sheet 05, and struct context on sheet 15. Explain a situation in which a single
process will have three sets of saved registers.

<p>
Some traps push an extra error code onto the stack (see Table 5-1 and Figure 5-3 from <a href=http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~sbansal/csl373/ref/ia32-3.pdf>Volume 3</a>). But this error code isn't pushed
by the INT instruction. Can the user confuse the kernel by invoking
"<code>INT 0xc</code>" (or any other vector that usually pushes an error
code)? Why not?

<p>
An interrupt can occur either while the processor was in user mode (ring 3)
or in kernel mode (ring 0). Depending on the ring level at which the
interrupt occurred, a different stack is used to push the interrupt
frame (CS, EIP, EFLAGS). If the interrupt caused a transition in
ring level (e.g., from ring 3 to ring 0), the processor also pushes SS
and ESP onto the stack. SS and ESP are not pushed to the stack if
no transition in privilege levels occurred. Why? Also, how
does <code>iret</code> instruction know how many words to pop?

<h3>Assignment Part 2 (fork)</h3>
In the function <code>sys_fork()</code>, why do we need to
store <code>pid</code>
in a temporary variable [1883]? 

<h3>Assignment Part 3 (context switch)</h3>
When one xv6 process switches to another, two calls to swtch()
are involved: one from sched() to
scheduler(), and one from scheduler() to sched(). Bugs Bunny
suggests eliminating one of the calls: sched() could call
a variant of scheduler() directly. The new code:
<pre>
// caller must hold proc_table_lock.
void
sched(void)
{
  scheduler2();
}
// caller must hold proc_table_lock.
void
scheduler2(void)
{
  struct proc *p;
  struct proc *from = cp; // remember who we are
  int i;
  for(;;){
    for(i = 0; i < NPROC; i++){
      p = &proc[i];
      if(p->state != RUNNABLE)
        continue;
      cp = p;
      setupsegs(p);
      p->state = RUNNING;
      swtch(&from->context, &p->context);
      // a return from swtch() means some other call to
      // scheduler2() decided to run us.
      cp = from;
      setupsegs(cp);
      return;
    }
    release(&proc_table_lock);
    acquire(&proc_table_lock);
  }
}
</pre>
This new swtch()-less sched() works most of the time, but not always. What is likely to go wrong?

<h3>Assignment Part 4 (user/kernel pointer bugs)</h3>
In <code>fetchint()</code> function [2766], why do we do seemingly redundant
checks for <code>addr</code> and <code>addr+4</code>? Can't we just
check <code>addr+4</code>?

<p>
<b>This completes the homework.</b>
