<h1>Homework: processes and threads</h1>

<p>This lecture covers scheduling policies of threads and processes.
Recall that a process is an abstraction which includes a program
counter, registers, and an address space which includes the code,
static data, stack and the heap. Threads are abstractions similar
to processes except that multiple threads can share the same
address space. Each thread has it's own program counter, registers
and stack. Threads can share code, static data, and heap. Threads
take significantly less space than processes because they don't require
separate address spaces.<br><br>

<b>Hand-In Procedure</b>
<p>
You are to turn in this homework during lecture. Please
write up your answers to the exercises below and hand them in to a
staff member at the beginning of lecture. Mention your CSE login
ID at the top of your homework submission.

<p><h2>Assignment Part 1 (Processes)</h2>

On a linux machine, type the following command
<pre>
$ <b>cat | tee output.file</b>

</pre>

<code>cat</code> is a UNIX utility that prints the contents of STDIN to STDOUT.
<code>tee</code> is a UNIX utility that prints the contents of STDIN to both STDOUT and to the file named by its argument (<code>output.file</code>). After you type this command, you can type in some characters followed by the newline character.

<p>
<b>Turn in:</b>
While this command is running, examine the processes created:
<ol>
  <li> Use <code>pstree</code> to see the process hierarchy. Tell us what you find about the process hierarchy. </li>
	<li> Use '<code>ps x</code>' to identify the process IDs of the processes created by <code>cat</code> and <code>tee</code> commands.
	Linux provides a <code>proc</code> pseudo-filesystem which can be used to examine the state of a process using filesystem namespace.
  <ul>
    <li> Type the following command for both process-ids:
    <pre>
    $ <b>ls -l /proc/<i>pid-num</i>/fd/</b>
    </pre>
    What do you find? What are 0,1,2,...? What do they symlink to?
    </li>
    <li>Type
    <pre>
    $ <b>cat /proc/<i>pid-num</i>/stack</b>
    </pre>
    Whose stack is this?
    </li>
    <li>Type
    <pre>
    $ <b>cat /proc/<i>pid-num</i>/maps</b>
    </pre>
    The <code>maps</code> file shows the address space of the process. You will
    find the output divided into columns. The leftmost column is
    the address space range and the rightmost column shows what is mapped into
    that column. You will see the code/data from the main executable mapped in
    some address ranges. You will also find other libraries that are loaded
    by this executable mapped in the address space.
    Can you identify where is code, static data, heap and stack
    mapped?
    </li>
  </ul></li>
</ol>

<p><h2>Assignment Part 2 (Threads)</h2></p>
Threads can be implemented completely at the user level. i.e., we do
not require privileged operations to implement a thread abstraction
and schedule different threads. In other words, a process can provide
multiple threads by implementing a scheduler. Let's see how this
can be done.

<p>To implement threads, the process needs to provide the abstraction
of multiple control-flow (program counter), multiple register
sets and multiple stacks. This can be done if after every periodic
time interval, one thread can be interrupted and saved and another
thread can be loaded. Saving a thread involves saving it's program
counter, registers and stack pointer. Similarly, loading a thread
involves loading the new thread's program counter, registers and stack
pointer. Neither the save operation, nor the load operation requires
any privileged operation -- we are just loading and saving registers.

<p>So the only remaining issue is how to periodically interrupt a
running thread from within a process. For an OS, this interruption
is done by the hardware timer device. A process can do this using
the SIGALRM signal.

<p>Such threads implemented inside a process are called user-level
threads. The OS cannot distinguish between multiple user-level threads
and it can only see one process that is running which includes the
thread scheduler and the different threads. 

<p><b>Turn in:</b><br>
Read the manpage of
the <code>signal</code>, <code>alarm</code>, and <code>setitimer</code>.
Understand how SIGALRM can
help in implementing user-level threads. Briefly describe how you
will do this (2-3 sentences and some pseudo-code).

<p><h2>Assignment Part 3 (Scheduling)</h2></p>
Carefully read <a href=../pintos/doc/pintos_2.html>Pintos Threads Assignment</a>
completely. <a href=../pintos/doc/pintos.html>Install pintos</a> and run it
using both <code>bochs</code> and
<code>qemu</code>. <a href=../tools.html>Tools page</a> has detailed instruction
on setting up and running pintos. Look through pintos source code and
design a solution. Ask your
doubts and questions during the lecture.

<p>Setup a subversion repository on CSC servers. Follow the instructions
on the <a href=../tools.html>tools</a> page.
Ensure that nobody else can access the files in your directory by
setting the file and directory permissions (using <code>chmod</code>).
See the CSC subversion page for details on how to do this. Maintaining
the security of your project files is your responsibility. If your
project files are visible to others (through any backdoor), we
will penalize you.

<p>
Logon to <code>palasi.cse.iitd.ernet.in</code> and type
"<code>submit-pintos base</code>". You will be prompted for the URL
of your repository. The script will tell you if your repository
is correctly formed. If the script does not succeed ("Submission NOT made."),
fix the reported errors and submit again. Your repository is expected
to be identical to the pintos source code provided by
us <a href=../pintos/doc/pintos.tar.gz>here</a>

<p><b>NOTE</b>: <em>'<code>submit-pintos</code>' is now functional.</em>

<p><b>Turn in:</b><br>
After you have submitted using the <code>submit-pintos</code> script,
write the URL of your repository in your written submission.
