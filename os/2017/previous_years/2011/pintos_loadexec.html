On some platforms, the following problem has been encountered:
<pre>
The file offset passed from the 'load' function to the 'load_segment'
function in process.c is coming out to be 0 whereas it should be 4096
(first page has the headers of the executable). I couldn't figure out why
this is happening
</pre>

Here is a temporary fix:
<pre>
In load function comment out a line as shown below:
       if (!load_segment (file, file_page, (void *) mem_page,
                   read_bytes, zero_bytes, writable))
               goto done;
       }
       else
       // goto done;
          break;
Also uncomment the lines in load_segment if you have commented it earlier.
 It should solve the problem.
