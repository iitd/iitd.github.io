Many students have reported that for the VM assignment, QEMU runs significantly
slower
on some systems (typically their laptops) and faster on GCL machines. The
performance difference is quite big -- often tests timeout on systems
that perform poorly.<br><br>

The assignment is the following:
<ul>
	<li> Identify a machine (configured with an OS) that performs poorly. If
	the machine is not your own, find a spare machine and re-install it's OS
	with the exact configuration of the slow machine to reproduce the performance
	bug. If you don't have a spare machine, talk to course staff and we can
	help you get one.</li>
	<li> Identify the cause of the performance slowdown on this machine.
	Hint: It is likely to be an OS configuration problem.</li>
</ul>
