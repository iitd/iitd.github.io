<h1>CPSC 422 Spring 2010 Lab 2: Processes and Synchronization</h1>
<p>
<b>Handed out Friday, January 29, 2010<br />
Due Thursday, February 11, 2010</b>

</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In this lab,
you will add the first major OS abstraction to PIOS: processes.
Like Unix, PIOS creates a single "root" process on startup
and allows that and any subsequent process to create "child" processes,
forming a process hierarchy.
PIOS's process abstraction is much simpler than Unix's, however:
for example,
child processes cannot outlive their parents,
and processes can directly interact <i>only</i>
with their immediate parent and immediate children,
not with arbitrary other processes in the system
like Unix processes can via pipes or the file system.
Philosophically, the PIOS process abstraction
follows more of a
<a href="../bib/goldberg74architecture.pdf"
	><i>recursive virtual machine</i></a>
or <a href="http://bford.info/pub/os/fluke-rvm.pdf"
	><i>nested process model</i></a>,
in contrast with Unix's timesharing-oriented job control model.

<p>
This lab contains the following four main implementation components:

<ol>
<li>	<b>Synchronization:</b>
	Maintaining the consistency of data structures
	in a multiprocessor kernel.

<li>	<b>Scheduling:</b>
	Determining which process to run on which CPU
	at a given moment, and running them.

<li>	<b>System calls:</b>
	Implementing system calls allowing process
	to create and manage child processes.

<li>	<b>Preemption:</b>
	Using asynchronous hardware interrupts to
	switch periodically among processes.
</ol>

<h3>Software Setup</h3>
<p>

In this lab you will build on the kernel you started in lab 1.
We will also provide you with some additional source code.
To fetch the new source code,
use Git to commit your Lab 1 source code if you haven't already,
then fetch the latest updates from the master Git repository,
and then create a local branch called <tt>lab2</tt> based on our lab2 branch,
which will be named <tt>origin/lab2</tt> in your copy of the repository:
</p>
<pre>
$ <kbd>cd lab</kbd>
$ <kbd>git commit -am 'my solution to lab1'</kbd>
Created commit 254dac5: my solution to lab1
 3 files changed, 31 insertions(+), 6 deletions(-)
$ <kbd>git pull</kbd>
Already up-to-date.
$ <kbd>git checkout -b lab2 origin/lab2</kbd>
Branch lab2 set up to track remote branch refs/remotes/origin/lab2.
Switched to a new branch "lab2"
</pre>

<p>
The <kbd>git checkout -b</kbd> command shown above actually does two
things: it first creates a local branch <tt>lab2</tt> that is
based on the <tt>origin/lab2</tt> branch provided by the course
staff, and second, it changes the contents of your <tt>lab</tt>
directory to reflect the files stored on the <tt>lab2</tt> branch.
Git allows switching between existing branches using <kbd>git
checkout <i>branch-name</i></kbd>, though you should commit any
outstanding changes on one branch before switching to a different
one.
</p>

<p>
You will now need to merge the changes you made in your <tt>lab1</tt>
branch into the new <tt>lab2</tt> branch, as follows:
</p>
<pre>
$ <kbd>git merge lab1</kbd>
Merge made by recursive.
 kern/kdebug.c  |   11 +++++++++--
 kern/monitor.c |   19 +++++++++++++++++++
 lib/printfmt.c |    7 +++----
 3 files changed, 31 insertions(+), 6 deletions(-)
</pre>

<p>
In some cases, Git may not be able to figure out how to merge your changes with
the new lab assignment (e.g. if you modified some of the code that
is changed in the second lab assignment).  In that case, the <kbd>git
merge</kbd> command will tell you which files are <i>conflicted</i>,
and you should first resolve the conflict (by editing the relevant files)
and then commit the resulting files with <kbd>git commit -a</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
Lab 2 contains the following new source files,
which you should browse through and familiarize yourself with:
</p>

<h3>Hand-In Procedure</h3>

<p>
<i>The exact handin procedure is to be determined;
we will update this section closer to the lab's due date.</i>

<p>
You do not need to turn in answers
to any of the questions in the text of the lab.
(Do answer them for yourself though!  They will help with the rest of the lab.)

<p>
We will be grading your solutions with a grading program.
You can run <kbd>make grade</kbd>
to test your solutions with the grading program.


<h2>Part 1: Multiprocessor Synchronization</h2>

<p>
Like xv6, PIOS is a multiprocessor kernel,
and will therefore have to use synchronization mechanisms
to ensure that different physical CPUs running kernel code concurrently
do not accidentally corrupt the kernel's data structures.
For now, PIOS will use only one simple synchronization abstraction
to protect kernel data structures: the <i>spinlock</i>.
Since xv6 also uses spinlocks in the kernel,
make sure you have read the xv6 chapter on locking
and thoroughly understand how xv6 implements and uses spinlocks
before you attempt this part of the lab.

<p>
PIOS's use of spinlocks will be different from xv6's
in one important way,
in terms of how spinlocks relate to interrupt handling.
The xv6 kernel can take asynchronous device interrupts
while running in either user or kernel mode,
and servicing those interrupts often requires acquiring spinlocks.
If an interrupt handler were to attempt to acquire a spinlock
that the interrupted code already holds, however,
then a deadlock would result:
the interrupt handler will spin
waiting for the "lock holder" to release the lock,
but the lock holder is the kernel code that was preempted by the interrupt!
So the xv6 spinlock code always disables hardware interrupts
when the kernel first takes a spinlock,
and re-enables interrupts only after unlocking the last spinlock it is holding,
effectively preemption whenever kernel code is holding any spinlock.
PIOS, in contrast,
simply never enables interrupts in the first place
while running in kernel mode,
so the spinlock code in PIOS doesn't need to deal with this issue.

<h3>Basic Spinlock Functionality</h3>

<p>
PIOS spinlocks are declared in <tt>kern/spinlock.h</tt>,
and support the following four operations:

<ul>
<li>	<tt>void spinlock_init(spinlock *<i>lk</i>)</tt>:
	initialize spinlock <i>lk</i> to the unlocked state.
<li>	<tt>void spinlock_acquire(spinlock *<i>lk</i>)</tt>:
	acquire spinlock <i>lk</i>, spinning if necessary
	until it becomes available.
<li>	<tt>void spinlock_release(spinlock *<i>lk</i>)</tt>:
	release spinlock <i>lk</i>.
<li>	<tt>int spinlock_holding(spinlock *<i>lk</i>)</tt>:
	return true (nonzero) if this CPU is holding spinlock <i>lk</i>,
	false (zero) otherwise.
</ul>

<p>
You will need to implement these four functions.
Use the <tt>xchg()</tt> function in <tt>inc/x86.h</tt>
to provide the atomicity needed when acquiring the spinlock.

<p>
You should also use the atomic <tt>xchg()</tt> instruction
to <i>release</i> the lock -
in this case not because of the atomicity it provides,
but because atomic instructions also prevent the processor
from reordering other reads or writes around the atomic instruction,
which modern processors often do with normal memory accesses,
and such reordering can cause synchronization code to fail
if not controlled carefully.
See section 7.2, "Memory Ordering", in the
<a href="../ref/ia32-3.pdf">IA-32 System Programming Guide</a>
for more information.

<p>
One further detail about the spin loop itself:
while a spinlock will work if you just do nothing in the loop,
Intel has defined a special instruction called <tt>PAUSE</tt>
that notifies the processor that a spin loop is in progress
and can improve system performance in such cases,
especially on "hyper-threaded" processors
that multiplex a single execution unit
among multiple virtual CPUs.
See the x86 manuals for details on this instruction.
We have provided a <tt>pause()</tt> function in <tt>inc/x86.h</tt>
for convenience.

<h3>Debugging Enhancements</h3>

<p>
While the main purpose of spinlocks is to ensure mutual exclusion,
and that can be accomplished if spinlocks are nothing but
a single word in memory,
we can make debugging multiprocessor code much easier 
by instrumenting spinlocks a little.
Design your spinlocks so that they:

<ul>
<li>	On initialization, save the file and line number
	of the <tt>spinlock_init()</tt> call that initialized the spinlock.
	This way, if your kernel gets into a spinlock-related deadlock,
	you can type CTRL-C in your GDB window,
	inspect the spinlock, and immediately see
	what the spinlock is used for based on where it was initialized.
	Note that <tt>spinlock_init()</tt> is actually a macro
	defined in <tt>kern/spinlock.h</tt> that invokes an actual function
	called <tt>spinlock_init_()</tt> with this file and line number;
	all you have to do is save this information in the spinlock.

<li>	Whenever a spinlock is held by a given CPU,
	save a pointer to that CPU's <tt>cpu</tt> struct in the spinlock,
	and clear it to NULL when releasing the spinlock.
	This way, if a deadlock occurs,
	you can see which (other) CPU is holding the lock you're spinning on.

<li>	When acquiring a spinlock,
	check to make sure the current CPU
	isn't <i>already</i> holding that spinlock,
	and panic if it is.
	This will turn a simple but very common class of deadlock bugs
	into immediate panics, which are much easier to debug.

<li>	Similarly, when releasing a spinlock,
	check to make sure that the current CPU
	<i>is</i> holding the spinlock,
	and panic if it isn't.

<li>	Finally, when acquiring a spinlock,
	use the <tt>debug_trace()</tt> function
	you implemented in the previous lab
	to take a backtrace of the contents of the stack
	at the time the spinlock was acquired,
	and save that backtrace in the <tt>eips</tt> array
	in the <tt>spinlock</tt> struct.
	This will further aid in debugging deadlocks,
	enabling you to see the exact call chain
	by which each of the spinlocks involved in the deadlock was acquired.
</ul>

These debugging facilities won't necessarily make
writing multiprocessor code "easy" per se,
but hopefully it may be a little easier than it would be otherwise!

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
	Implement spinlocks in PIOS as described above.
	Make sure your implementation passes
	the <tt>spinlock_check()</tt> test provided.
	But note that this test code only tests basic functionality;
	it does <i>not</i> verify that your spinlocks
	are properly atomic and race-free under multiprocessor operation!
</p></div>

<h3>Using Spinlocks</h3>

You will now need to use the spinlocks you have just implemented
to provide mutual exclusion for two existing kernel facilities:
the console code and the physical memory code from lab 1.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
	Add a spinlock to <tt>kern/console.c</tt>,
	initialized in <tt>cons_init()</tt>,
	which prevents the characters output
	by a <tt>cputs()</tt> call on one processor
	from being mingled with those output by another processor.
	In other words, we want each <tt>cputs()</tt> call to be atomic:
	if two CPUs try to print messages at about the same time,
	we want to see all of one message followed by all of the other,
	and not a random mix of characters from both messages at once.
</p></div>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>
	Add mutual exclusion to protect the <tt>mem_freelist</tt>
	in <tt>kern/mem.c</tt>,
	so that different CPUs can safely call
	<tt>mem_alloc()</tt> and <tt>mem_free()</tt> concurrently
	without pages being lost or the free list being corrupted.
</p></div>


<h2>Part 2: Creating and Scheduling Processes</h2>

<p>
First familiarize yourself with <tt>kern/proc.h</tt>
and the template code in <tt>kern/proc.c</tt>.
This will be PIOS's main process management and scheduling module.

<p>
As mentioned earlier,
PIOS processes form a strictly tree-structured process hierarchy.
The <tt>proc</tt> structure contains a <tt>parent</tt> pointer
and up to <tt>PROC_CHILDREN</tt> (256) <tt>child</tt> pointers
to child processes.
The <tt>parent</tt> pointer is NULL in the root process
but valid for all other processes;
any child pointer in a proc's <tt>child</tt> array may be NULL
indicating that child does not exist.

<table align="right" cellpadding=10>
<tr><td align="center"><img src="states.png">
<tr><td align="center"><b>PIOS Process State Machine</b>
</table>

<p>
At a given moment a process may be in any of four states,
as defined by the <tt>state</tt> field in the <tt>proc</tt> structure
and illustrated in the figure to the right:
<ul>
<li>	<tt>PROC_RUN</tt> means the process
	is currently running on some CPU.
	The <tt>runcpu</tt> field in the <tt>proc</tt> struct
	should point to the <tt>cpu</tt> struct of the CPU
	the process is currently running on when in this state;
	at all other times this field should be NULL.

<li>	<tt>PROC_READY</tt> means the process
	<i>has</i> been started by its parent process
	and is ready to run,
	but is not actually running yet on a physical CPU.
	The scheduler keeps track of all ready processes
	in some data structure -
	typically a queue -
	in order to decide which ready process to run next
	whenever a physical CPU becomes available to run a process.
	The <tt>readynext</tt> field in the <tt>proc</tt> struct
	is intended to be a next pointer to chain processes onto a ready queue,
	although you may use a different queueing mechanism if you wish.

<li>	<tt>PROC_STOP</tt> means the process is <i>stopped</i>,
	which means it is just passively sitting
	under the control of its immediate parent process.
	No stopped process ever runs until its parent explicitly starts it,
	using the PUT system call described later.
	Stopped processes can maintain saved register state
	(and after the next lab, virtual memory state as well),
	but nothing can cause this state to change or evolve
	except by the action of the parent process.

<li>	<tt>PROC_WAIT</tt> is complementary to the stopped state:
	it means the process is waiting for one of its <i>children</i>
	to finish executing and "return to" the parent
	by entering the stopped state.
</ul>

<h3>Scheduling and Running Processes</h3>

<p>
You will now need to design and implement a simple scheduler.
The scheduler can be as simple as keeping all ready processes
on a single queue and running them in round-robin order.
The main requirements for purposes of this lab are:
(a) the scheduler must work correctly, even on a multiprocessor system,
and never lose processes or corrupt the ready queue for example; and
(b) assuming the scheduler is invoked on a regular basis,
it must not "starve" any process of CPU time forever.
The second requirement means that while a simple queue structure will work,
a stack structure would not for example,
because processes pushed more recently on the stack
could starve processes pushed earlier forever.

<p>
We have declared and provided skeletons for the following scheduling functions;
you may add other helper functions and data structures as needed
in <tt>kern/proc.c</tt> and <tt>kern/proc.h</tt>:

<ul>
<li><p>	<tt>proc_ready(proc *<i>p</i>)</tt>:
	Places process <i>p</i> in the <tt>PROC_READY</tt> state
	and insert it into the ready queue,
	so that this or some other CPU will eventually run the process
	at some future invocation of the scheduler.

<li><p>	<tt>proc_sched(void)</tt>:
	Remove some process from the ready queue and run it.
	If the ready queue is currently empty
	(there is no work to do at the moment),
	just spin until some other CPU puts some work into the ready queue.
	(For good measure, use the <tt>pause()</tt> function
	discussed above in the ready loop,
	although this doesn't affect correctness.)

<li><p>	<tt>proc_run(proc *<i>p</i>)</tt>:
	Place process <i>p</i> in the <tt>PROC_RUN</tt> state,
	mark it as running on this CPU, and run it.
	This function does not return
	because it is expected to call <tt>trap_return()</tt>
	and enter user space to run the process.

<li><p>	<tt>proc_yield(trapframe *<i>tf</i>)</tt>:
	Put the currently running process on this CPU
	back in the <tt>PROC_READY</tt> state
	and yield its CPU to some other ready process.
	(The old process could end up yielding to itself
	if it is the only ready process.)
	This function is called with a pointer
	to a <tt>trapframe</tt> containing the user state
	of the process that is yielding the CPU,
	which was typically pushed on the kernel stack on kernel entry.
	Since the kernel stack is reset on switching to a new process,
	the old process's state needs to be saved in its <tt>proc</tt> struct
	before switching to the new process.
</ul>

You will of course need to make sure that
your implementations of these functions are multi-processor safe
via appropriate use of spinlocks.
Be sure to think carefully about what needs to be locked when.
Do you ever need to acquire two or more spinlocks at once,
e.g., the spinlocks in two different {\tt proc} structures?
If so, how can you ensure that you never deadlock?

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 4.</span>
	Implement the above scheduling functions.
	Then modify <tt>init()</tt> in <tt>kern/init.c</tt>
	so that instead of just conjuring up a <tt>trapframe</tt>
	and calling <tt>trap_return()</tt> directly to enter user space,
	it calls <tt>alloc_proc()</tt> to create a "root process",
	sets up that process's saved EIP and ESP
	to run the <tt>user()</tt> function on the <tt>user_stack</tt>,
	calls <tt>proc_ready()</tt> to make the process ready,
	and finally calls <tt>proc_sched()</tt> to schedule and run it.

	<p>
	You should now be able to get into user mode via your scheduler,
	although the root process won't yet be able to create other processes
	without the system calls to be implemented shortly.
	You may wish to test your scheduler a bit more thoroughly now
	by creating several "root" processes,
	starting them all at once,
	and ensuring that your schedule correctly picks a separate one
	to run on each physical CPU.
	But note that each user process will need its own stack!
</p></div>

<p>
<i>Hint:</i>
In general,
it may make debugging easier
if you get your code working first in a uniprocessor environment,
by removing the `<samp>-smp 2</samp>' option
from the <tt>qemu</tt> command line,
before trying to get it working in a multiprocessor environment.
If you are experiencing a mysterious bug,
always check to see if it goes away in uniprocessor mode:
if it does, it probably means it's a locking issue;
if it doesn't, it'll probably be easier to replicate and debug
in the simpler uniprocessor environment.

<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge:</span>
	Make your scheduler more powerful
	by implementing one of the enormous number of prioritization
	or fair-share scheduling algorithms you can find
	in textbooks or in the research literature:
	for example, fixed-priority scheduling,

	or <a href="../bib/waldspurger94lottery.pdf">lottery scheduling</a>.
</p></div>

<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge:</span>
	Make your scheduler more scalable
	by giving each CPU its own dedicated ready queue,

	You will still need locking, however,
	because when one CPU's ready queue is empty
	that CPU's scheduler will have to
	check other CPUs' ready queues and "steal" processes from them.
	This technique is called <i>work stealing</i>.
</p></div>

<h2>Part 3: System Calls</h2>

Now that your kernel has a way to create and schedule processes,
it needs to provide user-mode code a way to do something interesting.
User-mode processes invoke the kernel explicitly
through an x86 software interrupt (<tt>INT</tt> instruction)
to vector 0x30 (<tt>T_SYSCALL</tt>).

<h3>Entering, Completing, and Restarting System Calls</h3>

Before we get into the details of individual system calls,
we need to clarify a few general system call principles.

<p>
<b>Entering System Calls:</b>
When the processor encounters an explicit <tt>INT</tt> instruction,
it behaves in <i>mostly</i> the same way
as if it had encountered an exception such as divide-by-zero,
with two important differences:
<ul>
<li>	For <tt>INT</tt> instructions,
	the processor checks the current privilege level (CPL)
	against the descriptor privilege level (DPL) field
	in the IDT entry for the interrupt,
	and throws an exception if the currently running code
	does not have sufficient privilege
	to invoke that interrupt vector explicitly
	(effectively converting the <i>explicit</i> software interrupt
	into a different, <i>implicit</i> hardware-generated exception).

<li>	If everything goes well and the processor <i>does</i>
	successfully execute the <tt>INT</tt> instruction,
	the user-mode EIP it saves on the stack is different
	from the value it would push as a result of an exception.
	For exceptions, the saved EIP is a pointer
	<i>at</i> the instruction that caused the exception,
	whereas for successfully executed <tt>INT</tt> instructions,
	the saved EIP points to the next instruction
	<i>after</i> the <tt>INT</tt> instruction.
</ul>

<p>
Be sure you thoroughly understand both of these differences in behavior,
and the reasons for them!
Now we need to think about how PIOS actually processes system calls.

<p>
<b>Completing System Calls:</b>

When the kernel handles a system call,
in the "easy cases" it will complete whatever action the user process requested
and then need to resume execution of the user mode process
from where it left off.
In PIOS, the system call handler does this by calling <tt>trap_return()</tt>.

<p>
Given the above considerations regarding the value of EIP
that the processor pushes
when it successfully executes an <tt>INT</tt> instruction,
does the system call handler need to do anything
to the <tt>trapframe</tt> pushed on entry
before calling <tt>trap_return()</tt> to resume the user process?

<p>
<b>Blocking Processes and Restarting System Calls:</b>

In the "not so easy" system call handling cases,
the kernel may not be able to complete the system call immediately,
but instead must <i>block</i> the process until some future event occurs,
typically as a result of an action of some other process or an external device.
In a process-model kernel like xv6,
which maintains a separate kernel stack for each user process,
the kernel stack provides a convenient place
where the kernel can maintain state pertaining to
whatever system call was in progress when the process needed to block:
when the necessary "wakeup" condition is satisfied,
the process simply resumes executing in the kernel
at the intermediate system call processing state represented by the contents
of the process's kernel stack.

<p>
In an interrupt-model kernel such as PIOS, however,
processes do not have kernel stacks,
so a blocked process must entirely give up the use of the kernel stack
so that the next process to run on the same CPU can use it.
So how does the kernel keep track of what it was or is
supposed to be doing on behalf of a blocked process?
We <i>could</i> add explicit state to the <tt>proc</tt> structure
describe exactly what the kernel was supposed to be doing -
e.g., executing user-mode code,
or blocked at a particular stage in a particular system call.
Keeping track of this complicated state machine can be difficult, however.
Another option is to design the kernel's system calls
to be simple and semantically <i>atomic</i> -
meaning the system call either runs to completion
or blocks before changing any user-visible state at all.
That way, if a process needs to block waiting for some event to occur,
then once the process is woken by the occurrence of that event,
the process simply <i>restarts</i> the original system call from scratch -
beginning with the original <tt>INT</tt> instruction executed in user mode.
In this design, the only process state that really matters
is its user-mode register state, particularly its EIP.

<p>
PIOS takes the latter, <i>system call restart</i> approach,
because it simplifies kernel state
(and can have <a href="http://bford.info/pub/os/atomic-osdi99.pdf"
	>other kernel design advantages</a>).
To implement the restart model,
however,
you have to think carefully about exactly where you want
the user-mode EIP to point when you actually <i>complete</i> a system call,
versus what you want the saved EIP to point to
when you block the process <i>without</i> completing the system call.
Given the EIP that the processor saves in the <tt>trapframe</tt>
when it executes the <tt>INT</tt> instruction,
if the system call handler decides it needs to block the process,
does it need to do anything
to the <tt>trapframe</tt> before saving it into the <tt>proc</tt> structure
for use when the processor eventually wakes up and resumes execution?
<i>Hint:</i> how long exactly is an <tt>INT</tt> instruction?
(Look it up in the IA-32 manuals if you don't know.)

<h3>PIOS System Calls</h3>

We now examine the specific system calls PIOS supports.
PIOS for now implements only four system calls,
which we list according to their C function prototypes
as called from user space programs
(see <tt>inc/syscall.h</tt> and <tt>lib/syscall.c</tt>):

<ul>
<li><p>	<tt>sys_cputs(const char *<i>s</i>)</tt>:
	Print the null-terminated ASCII string <i>s</i> to the console
	for debugging purposes.

<li><p>	<tt>sys_put(uint32_t <i>flags</i>, uint8_t <i>child</i>,
		cpustate *<i>cpu</i>)</tt>:
	Initialize one of the calling process's 256 child process slots,
	as indicated by <i>child</i>,
	and optionally start the child process running
	concurrently with the parent.
	The <i>flags</i> argument contains a mask of flags
	defined in <tt>inc/syscall.h</tt>
	that modify <tt>sys_put</tt>'s precise behavior as follows:
	<ul>
	<li>	<tt>SYS_REGS</tt>:
		indicates that the calling process wishes to set
		the register state of the child process,
		from the <tt>tf</tt> member
		of the provided <tt>cpustate</tt> structure;
		otherwise the child's state remains unmodified
		(or initialized to all 0's, if the child is newly created).

		<p>
		The kernel shouldn't allow user processes
		to set <i>all</i> register state in another process:
		in particular, the kernel should force
		all the segment registers in the child's <tt>trapframe</tt>
		to the usual user-mode code and data segments,
		and should only allow "non-sensitive" bits in EFLAGS,
		such as the arithmetic condition code bits,
		to be set via this system call.
		Otherwise a process could trick the kernel
		into "returning" into a kernel-mode segment
		at an arbitrary EIP specified by the user process, for example.
		(Think about how you would implement this attack.)

	<li>	<tt>SYS_START</tt>:
		indicates that that the child process should start executing;
		otherwise the child remains in the stopped state.
	</ul>

	<p>
	This system call requires the specified child
	to be in the <tt>PROC_STOP</tt> state in order to complete.
	If the specified child process is not already in the stopped state
	when the parent process makes this system call,
	the kernel puts the parent process to sleep
	waiting for the child to stop.
	In other words, the parent goes into the <tt>PROC_WAIT</tt> state
	and sits there until the child enters the <tt>PROC_STOP</tt> state,
	at which point the parent wakes up
	and restarts its PUT system call as described above.

<li><p>	<tt>sys_get(uint32_t <i>flags</i>, uint8_t <i>child</i>,
		cpustate *<i>cpu</i>)</tt>:
	Collect information from a child process.
	As with <tt>sys_put()</tt>,
	this system call first waits for the child to stop
	if the child isn't already in the stopped state.
	The <i>flags</i> argument again determines
	exactly what information the parent retrieves from the child.
	Currently only one flag is supported,
	although we will add other flags in future labs:
	<ul>
	<li>	<tt>SYS_REGS</tt>:
		indicates that the calling process wishes to
		retrieve the register state of the child process;
		the kernel copies the child's register state
		into the <tt>tf</tt> member
		of the provided <tt>cpustate</tt> structure.
	</ul>

<li><p>	<tt>sys_ret(void)</tt>:
	Explicitly "returns" from a child process to its parent.
	The child process goes into the <tt>PROC_STOP</tt> state,
	and wakes up its parent
	if the parent happened to be waiting for this particular child,
	as a result of either a <tt>sys_put()</tt> or <tt>sys_get()</tt>.

	<p>
	If the parent subsequently retrieves this process's register state,
	the <tt>tf_trapno</tt> field in the returned <tt>trapframe</tt>
	should contain <tt>T_SYSCALL</tt>,
	indicating that the child "returned" via a system call,
	and the <tt>tf_eip</tt> field should point to
	the next instruction in the child <i>after</i> the system call.
	This way, a <tt>sys_ret()</tt> call by a child process
	doesn't need to "terminate" the child completely:
	instead, the parent can resume the child
	at the point in its execution immediately after the <tt>sys_ret()</tt>,
	just by calling <tt>sys_put()</tt> again
	with the <tt>SYS_START</tt> flag but without <tt>SYS_REGS</tt>.
</ul>

<h2>Part 4: Preemption and Trap Reflection</h2>

In this final part of the lab you will enhance the kernel's handling
of traps <i>other than</i> explicit system calls
to integrate with the scheduling and process management code above.

<h3>Preemption</h3>

If one process executes for too long,
we would like to <i>preempt</i> the CPU
and give other processes a chance to run.

<p>
To implement preemption,
we need to arrange for an asynchronous <i>timer interrupt</i>
to be delivered to each CPU periodically,
so that the processor will return control to the kernel
and the kernel can schedule and run a different process.
In multiprocessor x86 systems,
each CPU has a <i>Local Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller</i>
or LAPIC, which can generate such interrupts.
We have provided code in <tt>dev/lapic.{c,h}</tt>
to initialize each CPU's LAPIC and enable its periodic timer interrupt.
The processor will simply ignore these interrupt requests, however,
until the kernel enables interrupts
by setting the IF bit in the EFLAGS register.
Once interrupts are enabled,
timer interrupts will arrive at vector <tt>T_IRQ0+IRQ_TIMER</tt>.
In response,
the kernel should place the current process back on the ready queue,
and pick and run a new process from the ready queue.

<p>
When the kernel takes an asynchronous hardware interrupt,
it must signal the hardware that generated the interrupt
that the handling of the interrupt is complete:
otherwise,
the source of the interrupt 
(in this case the local APIC)
would just keep the interrupt request asserted,
interrupting the processor again immediately,
as soon as its IF flag is set again.
This "interrupt clearing" procedure is commonly called
an <i>End Of Interrupt</i> or EOI.
For interrupts generated by the local APIC,
we have provided a function <tt>lapic_eoi()</tt>
to signal the LAPIC that the timer interrupt has been handled.

<p>
As described in Section 8.9 of the
<a href="../ref/ia32-3.pdf">IA-32 System Programming Guide</a>,
certain corner-case timing situations can cause the Local APIC
to generate a <i>spurious interrupt</i>.
Our local APIC setup code directs such interrupts
to interrupt vector <tt>T_IRQ0+IRQ_SPURIOUS</tt>;
you should catch interrupts arriving at this vector
and simply do a <tt>trap_return()</tt>
without an EOI, as specified in the IA-32 manual.
You may want to print a message to a console on a spurious interrupt,
since they're not likely to happen often and if/when it does
you probably want to know so that you can tell
whether your spurious interrupt handler is working.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 6.</span>
	Implement preemption in PIOS.
	You will need to create entrypoints for the Timer IRQ
	and Spurious Interrupt vectors,
	and handle them in <tt>trap()</tt>.

	<p>
	You will also need to turn on the Interrupt Flag
	in order to allow the processor to take timer interrupts.
	Keep in mind, however, that the PIOS kernel assumes
	that the processor takes asynchronous hardware interrupts
	<i>only</i> when running in user mode,
	never while while running in kernel mode (as xv6 allows).
	You must be careful to preserve this design convention,
	otherwise the kernel will get very confused
	when it tries to preempt itself.
	How do you cause the IF flag to be set <i>only</i>
	while the processor is running in user mode?
	(<i>Hint:</i> the <tt>write_eflags()</tt> function
	in <tt>inc/x86.h</tt> is <i>not</i> what you want.)

	<p>
	Once you get interrupts working,
	your code should be able to get through
	the part of <tt>proc_chec()</tt> that uses 4 child processes,
	even when running on the default 2-CPU SMP configuration
	(or even a 1-CPU uniprocessor QEMU configuration).
</p></div>

<h3>Trap Reflection</h3>

While the <tt>sys_ret()</tt> system call
gives a PIOS process an <i>explicit</i> way to "return" to its parent,
a process can also <i>implicitly</i> return to its parent
by causing any other processor-defined exception,
such as a divide by zero or general protection fault.
That is, whenever a process causes an exception in user mode
that the PIOS kernel doesn't handle automatically in some way,
the kernel <i>reflects</i> reflects the trap to the process's parent
in the form of an implicit "return":
the process goes into the stopped state
and sits passively until the parent collects its state
via <tt>sys_get()</tt>.
In this case, the <tt>tf_trapno</tt> in the <tt>trapframe</tt> structure
that <tt>sys_get(SYS_REGS)</tt> returns to the parent
will indicate which trap the child process caused,
and the <tt>tf_eip</tt> will point at
(<i>not</i> after, as in the explicit <tt>sys_ret</tt> system call)
the instruction that caused the trap.
This reflection facility gives user-mode processes
the ability to "supervise" their children,
handling traps caused by their children in any way appropriate.
Of course, the kernel can't reflect traps caused by the root process
because the root process doesn't have a parent to reflect them to.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 7.</span>
	Implement reflection for processor exceptions
	in the x86 architecture-defined vector range of 0 through 31,
	but only if the exception occurs in user mode.
	(Exceptions in this range that occur in kernel mode
	still probably represent bugs and should cause a panic
	with a backtrace.)
	We have declared and provided a skeleton function
	<tt>proc_ret()</tt> in <tt>kern/proc.c</tt>,
	which is intended to handle
	either "explicit returns" via <tt>sys_ret()</tt>
	or "implicit returns" via other traps from user mode.

	<p>
	Your kernel should now be able to pass
	the entire <tt>proc_check()</tt> test,
	including its test of reflection for several types of traps.
	Run <tt>make grade</tt> to make sure
	the whole test suite for lab 2 comes out right.
