<h1>Homework: Files and Disk I/O</h1>

<p>
<b>Read</b>:
readi, writei, fileread, filewrite,
create, and dirlink, and code related to
these calls in fs.c, bio.c, ide.c, file.c, and sysfile.c

<p>
This homework should be turned in at the beginning of lecture.

<p>
<b>File and Disk I/O</b>

<p>Insert a print statement in bwrite so that you get a
print every time a block is written to disk:

<pre>
  cprintf("bwrite sector %d\n", b->sector);
</pre>

<p>Build and boot a new kernel and run these three commands at the shell:
<pre>
  echo &gt; a
  echo x &gt; a
  rm a
  mkdir d
</pre>

(Try <tt>rm d</tt> if you are curious; it should look much the same
as <tt>rm a</tt>.)

<p>You should see a sequence of bwrite prints after running each command.
Record the list and annotate it with the calling function and
what block is being written
(for example, "file's i-node block", "file's data block", &amp;c).
Hand in the annotated list.

<p>Hint: an easy way to get the name of the
calling function is to add a string argument to bwrite,
edit all the calls to bwrite to pass the name of the
calling function, and just print it.
You should be able to reason about what kind of
block is being written just from the calling function.

<p>You need not write the following up, but try to
understand why each write is happening.  This will
help your understanding of the file system layout
and the code.

<p>
<b>This completes the homework.</b>
