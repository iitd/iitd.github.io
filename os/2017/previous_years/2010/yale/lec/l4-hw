<h1>Homework: memory and processes in xv6</h1>



<p>
Be sure you have read <a href="../xv6-book/mem.pdf">xv6 chapter 2</a>
and familiarized yourself with the xv6 code it refers to before lecture.

<p>
Use QEMU with GDB to trace through the free list creation
and memory allocation process described in the first part of the chapter.
Make sure you understand how the C pointer arithmetic
in <code>kfree</code>'s <code>for</code> loop works:
especially the relationship between the
<samp>rp</samp>, <samp>r</samp>, and <samp>p</samp> variables.

<p>
Also step through
the creation of the first process by <code>allocproc()</code>,
and then step through the first context switch <i>into</i> that process
via the assembly language <code>swtch()</code> code.

<p>
<b>Nothing to turn in for this lecture.</b>
