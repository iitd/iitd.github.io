<h1>Homework: locking, memory hierarchy</h1>
<!--<i>You do NOT need to turn in this homework. It is only for your practice.</i>-->

<h3>Assignment Part 1 (locking)</h3>


<p>
<b>Read</b>: spinlock.c

In this part of the assignment we will explore some of the interaction
between interrupts and locking.
<p>

Make sure you understand what would happen if the kernel executed
the following code snippet:
<pre>
  struct spinlock lk;
  initlock(&amp;lk, "test lock");
  acquire(&amp;lk);
  acquire(&amp;lk);
</pre>
(Feel free to use QEMU to find out.  <code>acquire</code> is in <code>spinlock.c</code>.)
<p>

An <code>acquire</code> ensures interrupts are off
on the local processor using the <code>cli</code> instruction
(via <code>pushcli()</code>),
and interrupts remain off until the <code>release</code>
of the last lock held by that processor
(at which point they are enabled using <code>sti</code>).
<p>

Let's see what happens if we turn on interrupts while
holding the <code>ide</code> lock.
In <code>iderw</code> in <code>ide.c</code>, add a call
to <code>sti()</code> after the <code>acquire()</code>,
and a call to <code>cli()</code> just before the <code>release()</code>.
Rebuild the kernel and boot it in QEMU.
Chances are the kernel will panic soon after boot; try booting QEMU a few times
if it doesn't.
<p>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Turn in:</span>
explain in a few sentences why the kernel panicked.
You may find it useful to look up the stack trace
(the sequence of <code>%eip</code> values printed by <code>panic</code>)
in the <code>kernel.asm</code> listing.
</p></div>

Remove the <code>sti()</code> and <code>cli()</code> you added,
rebuild the kernel, and make sure it works again.
<p>

Now let's see what happens if we turn on interrupts
while holding the <code>file_table_lock</code>.
This lock  protects the table of file descriptors,
which the kernel modifies when an application opens or closes
a file.
In <code>filealloc()</code> in <code>file.c</code>, add
a call to
<code>sti()</code> after the call to <code>acquire()</code>,
and a <code>cli()</code> just before <b>each</b> of the
<code>release()</code>es.
You will also need to add 
<code>#include "x86.h"</code> at the top of the file after
the other <code>#include</code> lines.
Rebuild the kernel and boot it in QEMU.
It will not panic.
<p>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Turn in:</span>
explain in a few sentences why the kernel didn't panic.
Why do <code>file_table_lock</code> and <code>ide_lock</code> have
different behavior in this respect?
<p>
You do not need to understand anything about the details of the IDE hardware
to answer this question, but you may find it helpful to look 
at which functions acquire each lock, and then at when those
functions get called.
</p></div>

<p>
(There is a very small but non-zero chance that the kernel will panic
with the extra <code>sti()</code> in <code>filealloc()</code>.
If the kernel <i>does</i> panic, make doubly sure that
you removed the <code>sti()</code> call from 
<code>iderw</code>.  If it continues to panic and the
only extra <code>sti()</code> is in <code>filealloc()</code>,
then email the staff
and think about buying a lottery ticket.)
<p>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Turn in:</span>
Why does <code>release()</code> clear
<code>lk-&gt;pcs[0]</code> and <code>lk-&gt;cpu</code>
<i>before</i> clearing <code>lk-&gt;locked</code>?
Why not wait until after? 
</p></div>

Now look at the <code>lock_acquire()</code> and <code>sema_down</code>
functions in <code>pintos</code> source code.
The <code>sema_down()</code> function in <code>pintos</code> first disables
interrupts and
then re-enables interrupts (or sets them to their original status)
before returning. Whereas xv6 <code>acquire()</code> function keeps interrupts
disabled. Also, <code>sema_down()</code> blocks the thread, while
<code>acquire()</code> busy waits.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Turn in:</span>
Why does <code>sema_down()</code> need to disable (and re-enable) interrupts?
Will this implementation work on a multiprocessor? If not, how will you
change it so that it works on multiprocessors too? Provide code (or pseudo-code).
</p></div>


<h4>Uniprocessor Locking</h4>
A uniprocessor OS does not require atomic instructions like
<code>xchg</code> to implement locks (or other forms of
synchronization). The concurrency on uni-processor systems
is due to pre-emption of threads by the timer interrupt.
Because the timer interrupt may pre-empt a thread at
any point in program execution, instructions of two
threads may interleave in any arbitrary order.
<br><br>
Synchronization primitives that work on multi-processor
systems are guaranteed to work on uni-processor systems (reason
it for yourself). On uniprocessor systems,
it is also possible to implement critical
sections by disabling interrupts.
<br><br>
Here are some (possibly incorrect) implementations
of <code>lock()</code> and
<code>unlock()</code> primitives using interrupt enable and
disable mechanisms. Answer the associated questions.

<pre>
lock(L) {
  cli();   //disable preemption
  while (L==0) continue;
  L = 0;
  sti();   //enable preemption
}

unlock(L) {
  L = 1;
}
</pre>
Does this implementation of locks work on a uniprocessor? If not, why not?

<pre>
lock(L) {
  int acquired = 0;
  while (!acquired) {
    cli();
    if (L == 1) {
        acquired = 1;
        L = 0;
    }
    sti();
   }
}

unlock(L) {
  L = 1;
}
</pre>
Does this implementation of locks work on a uniprocessor? If not, why not?

<h3>Assignment Part 2 (sleep and wakeup)</h3>
Here is a version of the code for a single-queue, multiple-consumer,
mutiple-producer problem.
<pre>
struct pcq {
    void *ptr;
    struct spinlock lock;
};

void*
pcqread(struct pcq *q)
{
    void *p;

    acquire(&amp;q->lock);
    while(q-&gt;ptr == 0)
        sleep(q, &amp;q->lock);
    p = q-&gt;ptr;
    q-&gt;ptr = 0;
    wakeup(q);  /* wake pcqwrite */
    release(&amp;q->lock);
    return p;
}

void
pcqwrite(struct pcq *q, void *p)
{
    acquire(&amp;q->lock);
    while(q-&gt;ptr != 0)
        sleep(q, &amp;q->lock);
    q-&gt;ptr = p;
    wakeup(q);  /* wake pcqread */
    release(&amp;q->lock);
    return p;
}
</pre>
<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Turn in:</span>
Both producer (<code>pcqwrite</code>) and consumer (<code>pcqread</code>)
are sleeping on the  same channel <code>q</code>. Is this correct? Why or
why not? Should they sleep on different channels? For example, what happens
if the producer calls
<code>wakeup(q)</code>? Can some unrelated part of the code call wakeup
a consumer thread?
</p></div>

<h2>Assignment Part 3 (more synchronization)</h2>
Read <a href=http://poorvi.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~sbansal/csl373/resources/kaashoek-concurrency.ps>Kaashoek's Concurrency Notes</a> (internal link only). Read
them again, and understand
the subtleties of synchronization primitives.<br><br>
<em>Nothing to turn in for this part (but remember we can ask you questions in
	the exams/surprise quizzes on this material).</em>

<h2>Assignment Part 4 (I/O top)</h2>
Study the <code>iotop</code> utility available on most Linux distributions. Run
some I/O intensive applications and notice the disk throughput. Also, notice
the time spent in waiting for "swap-in" and file I/O.
<h2>Assignment Part 5 (Single consumer, single producer)</h2>
Consider the following code for a single consumer, single producer problem:
<pre>
struct pcq {
    void *ptr;
    struct spinlock lock;
};

void*
pcqread(struct pcq *q)
{
    void *p;

    acquire(&amp;q->lock);
    if (q-&gt;ptr == 0)
        sleep(q, &amp;q->lock);
    p = q-&gt;ptr;
    q-&gt;ptr = 0;
    wakeup(q);  /* wake pcqwrite */
    release(&amp;q->lock);
    return p;
}

void
pcqwrite(struct pcq *q, void *p)
{
    acquire(&amp;q->lock);
    if (q-&gt;ptr != 0)
        sleep(q, &amp;q->lock);
    q-&gt;ptr = p;
    wakeup(q);  /* wake pcqread */
    release(&amp;q->lock);
    return p;
}
</pre>
<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Turn in:</span>
Is this code correct? (Notice that we have replaced <code>while</code> with
</code>if</code> in both producer and consumer before sleeping). Would this
code remain correct if <code>release(q->lock)</code> is moved before
<code>wakeup(q)</code>? If yes, why? If not, what is the problem?
</p></div>

<h2>Assignment Part 4 (memory hierarchy)</h2>
<em>Warning: This part of the assignment is lengthy. Start early.</em><br><br>
Exercise 5.2 of "Computer Architecture: A Quantitative
Approach (Third Edition)" by
J. Hennessy and D. Patterson. Implement the program, identify
a machine (it can be your personal computer/laptop), and run the program
on it. Then answer the questions using what you observe. Compare your
observations with published numbers that you may find (from the Internet or
your machine's manual)
on that processor/machine model. Report the machine model and other
published information on it too.<br><br>
