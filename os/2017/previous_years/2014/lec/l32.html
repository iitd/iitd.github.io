    notes for next year:
	- explain more clearly where the FS comes from (mkfs), which parts

	- set up the foray into asynchronous writes much more explicitly,

<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li>DOS FAT: Cute modification to linked list. Links reside in fixed
	 size File Allocation Table (FAT). Still need to do pointer chasing but
	 the entire FAT can fit in memory so chasing cheap.
	 <ul>
		 <li>Discussion (Entry size = 16 bits for FAT16, 28 bits for FAT32):
			 <ul>
				 <li>What's the maximum size of the FAT? (2<sup>16</sup> for FAT16,
				 2<sup>28</sup> for FAT32)
				 <li>Each entry descibes a "block" that may be made up of multiple
				 contiguous sectors.
				 <li> Given a 2KByte block, what's the maximum size of FS?
				 (2<sup>16</sup>*2KB=128MB for FAT16, 2<sup>28</sup>*2KB=512GB for
				 FAT32)
				 <li>Option: go to bigger blocks. FAT allows 2-32KB block sizes.
				 Block size
				 fixed for a disk partition at format time (called
				 "Allocation Unit Size"). Pro? Bigger disk, better spatial
				 locality exploitation. Con? Internal fragmentation, more time
				 for data transfer than strictly needed, buffer cache pollution.
			 </ul>
			 <li>Space Overhead of FAT16: 4 bytes/2Kbyte block = approx .2%
			 <li>Reliability: create duplicate copies of FAT to protect against
			 errors
			 <li>Bootstrapping: Where is root directory? Fixed location on disk /
			 have a table in the bootsector (sector 0)
			 </li>
		 </ul>
		 </li>
		 <li>Indexed Files: Each file has an array holding all it's block pointers.
		 Fill in the block pointers as file grows/shrinks.
		 <ul>
			 <li>Pros: Fast random access, easy growth
			 <li>Cons: Slow sequential access, growth beyond index size clumsy. Index
			 size? (filesize/blocksize)*4 (assuming 4 bytes per block pointer).
		 </ul></li>
		 <li>Multi-level Indexed Files (BSD/Unix/xv6): Direct blocks, Indirect
		 blocks, Double-indirect blocks. Caters to common case of small files.
		 Handles large files. Example: 4.3 BSD Unix
		 <ul>
			 <li>Inode contains 14 4-byte block pointers (initally 0, indicating no block)
			 <li>First 12 point to data blocks
			 <li>Next entry points to an indirect block containing
			 1024 4-byte block pointers
			 <li>Last entry points to a doubly-indirect block.
			 <li>Maximum file length is fixed, but large.
			 <li>Indirect blocks are not allocated until needed.
			 <li>Common case: small files require only one extra disk access
			 for metadata lookup (inode lookup). Larger files require 2 or 3
			 metadata lookups.
		 </ul>
	 </ul>

<!--<p>What makes filesystems hard/interesting?  At one level, it's much
    like any other part of an OS: trying to achieve good performance
    and provide useful functionality for lots of different applications
    with very different workload characteristics.
		However, more specifically:-->

<p>A design issue is the semantics of a file system operation that
  requires multiple disk writes.  In particular, what happens if the
  logical update requires writing multiple disks blocks and the power
  fails during the update?  For example, to create a new file,
  requires allocating an inode (which requires updating the list of
  free inodes on disk), writing a directory entry to record the
  allocated i-node under the name of the new file (which may require
  allocating a new block and updating the directory inode).  If the
  power fails during the operation, the list of free inodes and blocks
  may be inconsistent with the blocks and inodes in use. Again this is
  up to implementation of the file system to keep on disk data
  structures consistent:

<ul>
<li>Don't worry about it much, but use a recovery program to bring
    file system back into a consistent state.  Linux ext2 and FAT
    are such examples.  xv6 is almost in this category, except that
    it has no recovery program.

<li>Journaling all file system state (kernel-managed structure as
		well as user-managed data). As we will discuss later,
journaling provides atomicity over multiple disk operations.
This tends to be quite
    expensive, in terms of performance.  Linux's ext3 has
    a full data journaling mode that behaves in this fashion.

<li>Journaling only state that maintains kernel invariants. 
    Never let the file system metadata get into an
    inconsistent state.  In some sense, this resembles
    how the kernel deals with killing user processes:
    it cleans up kernel structures, so kernel invariants
    are upheld, but ignores application invariants.
    NTFS does this, as does Linux ext3 by default.
</ul>

<p>Another design issue is the semantics are of concurrent writes to
the same data item.  What is the order of two updates that happen at
the same time? For example, two processes open the same file and write
to it.  Modern Unix operating systems allow the application to lock a
file to get exclusive access.  If file locking is not used and if the
file descriptor is shared, then the bytes of the two writes will get
into the file in some order (this happens often for log files).  If
the file descriptor is not shared, the end result is not defined. For
example, one write may overwrite the other one (e.g., if they are
writing to the same part of the file.)  Lots of other examples with
directories, names, etc.

<p>An implementation issue is performance, because writing to magnetic
disk is relatively expensive compared to computing. Three primary ways
to improve performance are: careful file system layout and data structure
design that induces few seeks (locality, btrees, logging, etc), an
in-memory cache of frequently-accessed blocks (or even prefetching),
and overlap I/O with computation so that file operations don't have
to wait until their completion and so that that the disk driver has
more data to write, which allows disk scheduling.
(We will talk about performance in detail later.)

<h2>xv6 code examples</h2>

<p>xv6 implements a minimal Unix file system interface. xv6 doesn't
pay attention to file system layout. It overlaps computation and I/O,
but doesn't do any disk scheduling.  Its cache is write-through, which
simplifies keeping on disk data structures consistent, but is bad for
performance.

<p>What is xv6's disk layout?  Who determines how many inodes, blocks,
  etc. (mkfs.c). How does xv6 keep track of free blocks and inodes?
  See balloc()/bfree() and ialloc()/ifree().  Is this layout a good
  one for performance?  What are other options?

	<ul>
		<li>Block 0 is unused
		<li>Block 1 is super block
		<li>Inodes start at block 2
		<li>Free-block bitmap at block <code>ninodes/IPB + 3</code>
		<li>Free blocks after that
	</ul>
	Free blocks are tracked using bitmap. Free inodes are tracked by
	linearly scanning the inode array to find one that is free.
	Other options (bitmap for inodes, better locality among inodes
	and blocks)

<p>On disk, files are represented by an inode (struct dinode in fs.h),
and blocks.  Small files have up to 12 block addresses in their inode;
large files use the last address in the inode as a disk address
for a block with 128 disk addresses (512/4).  The size of a file is
thus limited to 12 * 512 + 128*512 bytes.  What would you change to
support larger files? (Ans: e.g., double indirect blocks.)

<p>Directories are files with a bit of structure to them. The file
contains of records of the type struct dirent.  The entry contains the
name for a file (or directory) and its corresponding inode number.

<p>
Directory contents: A directory is much like a file, but
user can't directly write or read from it. It can only do so
using system calls like <code>readdir()</code>. Also, the kernel
reads the contents to do path resolution (e.g., converting
"x/y" to inode number). The content of a "directory file" is an
array of dirents (notice that the contents are structured this time).
<br>
dirent:
<ul>
		<li> inum
		<li> 14-byte file name
</ul>
dirent is free if inum is zero
<br>
How many files can appear in a directory?
(max file size / sizeof(struct dirent))

<p>xv6's on-disk inode (64 bytes):
<ul>
	<li> type (free, file, directory, device)
	<li> nlink
	<li> size
	<li> addrs[12+1]<br>
  direct and indirect blocks
</ul>

<p>
Each i-node has an i-number. To turn i-number into inode's
block, use 2 + inum/IPB. (IPB = inodes per block). Blocksize=512
inodesize=64, IPB=8

<p>
Can view FS as an on-disk data structure. Draw tree: dirs, inodes, blocks.
There are two allocation pools: inodes and blocks.

<p>Q: how does xv6 create a file?:
<pre>
$ echo &gt; a
log_write 4 ialloc (44, from create 54)
# allocating an inode for a

log_write 4 iupdate (44, from create 54)
# updating the inode of a

log_write 29 writei (47, from dirlink 48, from create 54)
# adding entry for a in the contents to the current working directory

log_write 2 iupdate
# updating the inode of the current working directory.
</pre>

	<!--
<p>Let's look at:
<pre>
echo > a
echo x > a
echo < a > b
rm a
mkdir b
</pre>

<p>What file systems operations do these shell commands invoke?

<p>1rst command. Let's walk through sys_open, create, etc, skipping
  directory stuff, and look at the number of disk writes.  study
  ialloc; layout of inodes.

<p>buffer cache caches blocks containing inodes. what replacement
policy does the buffer cache implement?  (LRU, look at bget() which
traverses the list in reverse order to find a free block; brelease() adds the
block to the start of the list). what is B_BUSY? (the buffer is being
used) B_VALID? (the buffer has been loaded with disk's contents).
why does bget() panic if there's no free blocks?  (because this means
that these many threads are concurrently trying to read something off the
block, which should be a rare occasion. we expect the programmer to
release the block as soon as he is done; notice that the block still
has valid metadata and data so can be locked again if needed without
going to the disk). could we sleep? (we could).
  if the block wasn't in the cache, read it from disk - are read's
	synchronous or asynchronous? (synchronous)
	why does the ide driver need a queue? (so that many processes can
	simultaneously wait on the disk). Given that we have a queue of
	requests, what could we have done better? (process the requests using
	elevator algorithm perhaps). We are allowing only single request
	in flight to disk at a time. Modern disk controllers will allow
	many requests to be in flight and perform scheduling internally.

	<p>what does ilock(ip) after ialloc() do? (processes are only allowed
	to read and write inode metadata and contents when holding the inode's
lock).	how does ilock() implement
locks? (using icache.lock and I_BUSY flag and sleep/wakeup).
why not use a spinlock to lock an inode?  (too expensive)
why have locks? (protect against concurrent access to the same file).
  Atomic read and update.  For example, allocating an inode: read
  block containing inode, mark it allocated, and write it back.  This
	operation must be atomic (guaranteed with lock on buffer cache). 
	Are writes write-through? (yes)

<p>Returning to create, why is the update of the inode before the
update of the directory?  (to avoid dangling pointers on crash)
Can we make the disk write asynchronous? (yes)
Is there any reason to wait in ide_rw() if we're writing a block? (no,
the order of disk writes is still preserved).

<p>2nd command: write a block. bmap allocates block.  is data written
to disk? (yes) must it? (no)

<p>3rd command. read. does the read cause a disk read to happen? (no, file a's
inode and data is still in the buffer cache).

<p>4th command. unlink.  why are the old block written? (the old block is
written with the new value of nlink which has been decremented). iunlockput()
will then truncate the file using itrunc(), free the inode by setting it's
type to 0. So the old block may have to be written twice actually.)

</ul>
