<h3>Assignment Part 1 (traps)</h3>

xv6 defines two structures that hold saved registers for a process: struct
trapframe on sheet 06, and struct context on sheet 20. Explain a situation
in which a suspended process will have three sets of saved registers in
its kstack.
<ul>
	<li> Is it possible to have two "context" structures and
one "trapframe" structure on the kstack? If so, when? If
not, why not?
  <li>Is it possible
to have two trapframe structures and one context structure on the kstack.
If so, when? If not, why not?
  <li>Is it possible to have more than three sets of saved registers
	in the kstack? If so, when? If not, why not?
</ul>

<h3>Assignment Part 2 (context switching)</h3>
<p>
<b>Read</b>: swtch.S and proc.c (focus on the code that switches
between processes, specifically <code>scheduler</code> and <code>sched</code>).
Also process creation: sys_fork() and copyproc().

<p>
In this part of the homework you will investigate how the
kernel switches between
two processes. 

<p>
<b>Assignment</b>:
<p>

Suppose a process that is running in the kernel
calls <code>sched()</code>, which ends up jumping
into <code>scheduler()</code>.

<p>
<b>Turn in</b>: 
Where is the stack that <code>sched()</code> executes on?

<p>
<b>Turn in</b>: 
Where is the stack that <code>scheduler()</code> executes on?

<p>
<b>Turn in:</b>
When <code>sched()</code> calls <code>swtch()</code>,
does that call to <code>swtch()</code> ever return? If so, when?

<p>
Now think back to gcc calling conventions and the invariants
that gcc expects any function, including <code>swtch</code>, to
maintain.  Compare these invariants with what <code>swtch</code>
actually implements, and the state that our kernel maintains in
a <code>struct context</code>.

<p>
<b>Turn in</b>: Could <code>swtch</code> do less work and still be
correct?  Could we reduce the size of a <code>struct context</code>?
Provide concrete examples if yes, or argue for why not.

<p>
Surround the call to <code>swtch()</code> in <code>scheduler()</code> with calls
to <code>cprintf()</code> like this:
<pre>
  cprintf("a");
  swtch(&cpu->scheduler, &proc->context);
  cprintf("b");
</pre>
<p>
Similarly,
surround the call to <code>swtch()</code> in <code>sched()</code> with calls
to <code>cprintf()</code> like this:

<pre>
  cprintf("c");
  swtch(&proc->context, cpu->scheduler);
  cprintf("d");
</pre>
<p>
Rebuild your kernel and boot it on QEMU.
With a few exceptions
you should see a regular four-character pattern repeated over and over.

<p>
<b>Turn in</b>: What is the four-character pattern?

<p>
<b>Turn in</b>: The very first characters are <code>ac</code>. Why does
this happen?
