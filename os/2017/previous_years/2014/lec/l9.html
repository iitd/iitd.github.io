<h2>Review : Segmentation, Interrupt Descriptor Table, Kernel stacks</h2>
If there is only one CPU, only one process could be running on the CPU
at any time. The kernel time-slices the CPU execution time, so that multiple
processes appear to run concurrently. As we saw last time, while a process
is running the kernel is <em>not</em> controlling the
CPU at that time. The kernel regains control of the CPU if one of
the following occurs, for example:
<ul>
	<li> The process makes a system call
	<li> The process causes an exception
	<li> An external interrupt occurs
</ul>
The Interrupt Descriptor table specifies what code to execute, and at what
privilege level, on any of these events, based on the corresponding
interrupt vector number.

<p>If there are multiple CPUs, each CPU independently executes in this
fashion. For example, one CPU could be executing a process, while another
CPU could be executing in the kernel mode. Notice that by definition, one
process (or one thread of a process, if a process could have multiple
threads) may only be executing on at most one CPU at any time.

<p>
On a switch from process execution to kernel execution (from unprivileged
to privileged mode), the CPU also switches the stacks. The stack for the
kernel mode is obtained using the Task State Segment (TSS).
If the kernel uses a <em>process model</em>, each process will
have a separate kernel stack. Hence, the kernel must load the kernel
stack of the process into TSS, before transferring execution control to
that process.

<p>If the kernel uses an <em>interrupt model</em>, each CPU
has only one stack, which remains constant throughout the execution of the
system. In this case, every switch from the process to the kernel starts
on a <em>clean</em> stack, i.e., on an entry it will only contain the
values pushed by this
switch (e.g., saved SS, saved ESP, saved EFLAGS, saved CS, saved EIP).
A kernel may want to interrupt its own execution, while it was running
on behalf of a process. For example, this can happen if the process made
a system call to read contents from a disk file. Reading the file contents
may take a long time, and so the kernel may want to <em>context switch</em>
to another process while the disk is responding. In this case, the
kernel must save the contents of the current stack
(somewhere in its data structures where it maintains per-process
information), before loading the new
process. In future, if the kernel wants to switch back to the old process
(e.g., if the disk device has supplied the requested contents of the file),
the kernel must initialize the stack using the saved contents, before
transferring control to the old process.

<p>In the process model, the kernel is always executing in the
context of the stacks of one of the processes. If the kernel wants to
interrupt its execution, it simply saves the current
stack pointer, and loads the
stack pointer of the new process. On a return to the old process, the old
stack pointer is restored.

<p>
The kernel needs to store information per process. For example, it needs
to store the list of all processes, their state (e.g., are they ready
to run, are they waiting for an event to complete, are they already
running, etc.), values that define their address space (e.g., segment
selectors), and values that define their kernel stacks (stack
pointers in process model, or contents of the stack in the interrupt model).

<p>This information is typically stored as a
list of ``Process Control Blocks'' (PCBs).
Each PCB contains process state:
<ul>
	<li> pid
	<li> state : ready, running, blocked, etc.
	<li> address space (e.g., segment selectors)
	<li> kernel stack
	<li> saved registers
	<li> other information
</ul>
This list is allocated in the kernel address space (inaccessible to the
other processes). The "handlers" consult these data structures to decide
what action to take on any interrupt/exception.

<p>For the most part, the kernel starts execution in one of the
handlers. For example, the kernel implements a system call handler that
internally calls the functions that implement the functionality of that
call. One of the system calls is <code>yield()</code>, which tells the
kernel that the process is interested in relinquishing
the CPU to another
process (if any exists). This may happen if a process is waiting for an event,
and
knows that it is going to take a long time. In this case, instead of
occupying the CPU, a process may make the "good gesture" of calling
<code>yield()</code>.

<p>If a process does not call <code>yield()</code>, the kernel has other
mechanisms to take control away from the process. This is called
preemption of a process. Preemption is necessary to ensure that the process
cannot keep executing forever, and the OS
can acquire control back. A typical way to do this is to use a hardware
timer device. The OS configures the timer device to generate an interrupt
periodically. It then sets up the interrupt handler for the timer interrupt,
before tranferring control to the process. On a timer interrupt the
kernel's handler is invoked, and it is free to let the process continue
execution (by simply returning from
the interrupt), or to <em>context-switch</em> to another process (which
involves saving the current state of the execution of the current
process and loading the state of execution of the new process, before
returning from the interrupt).

<p>Typically, the kernel will have 4-5 descriptor entries
in the GDT. One of those
entries will define the kernel address space (using <code>kbase</code>
and <code>klimit</code>), and another one will define the user (or process)
address space (using <code>ubase</code> and <code>ulimit</code>). On
a context switch, the kernel will overwrite the descriptor entry containing
<code>ubase</code> and <code>ulimit</code> with the base and limit of
the new process, before transferring control to it.
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<ul>
	<li> <b>GDT can have up to 2^13 entries. Why can't we use one entry per process? 
		Why do we need to overwrite GDT entries on every context switch?</b><br>
	Because when one process (say P1) is running, the address space of another
	process (say P2) should not be accessible through the GDT. So it makes sense
	to overwrite P2's GDT descriptor (its base and limit) with P1's GDT
	descriptor before context switching to P1.
	<li> <b>Why does the GDT have 2^13 entries? Isn't this very wasteful, if we
		are going to use only 4-5 entries?</b><br>
	Actually the hardware allows you to specify the size of the GDT (which can
	be up to 2^13 entries). The GDTR register actually
	points to a memory area of six
	bytes that specifies the GDT base and the GDT size. (see the semantics
	of the LGDT instruction in
	<a href=http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~sbansal/os/ref/ia32-2.pdf>Intel Reference
		Manual volume 2</a> (page 427) for full details.
	<li> <b>Can a process customize interrupt/exception handlers?</b><br>
	The UNIX abstractions do not allow this. But one could potentially design
	an OS where this is allowed. Customization in UNIX is done through
	<em>signal handlers</em>, but the mapping of exceptions to signals is
	fixed inside UNIX. Also signal handlers execute in unprivileged mode.
	<li> <b>Why have two abstractions: signal handlers (for process) and trap handlers (for kernel)?</b><br>
	Traps are a hardware abstraction. Signals are an operating system abstraction.
	It is possible for an OS to not have signals (this is an OS design decision),
	and yet support traps from the hardware. Similarly, not all signals are
	caused due to hardware traps (e.g., signals can be generated using the
	kill system call).
	<li> <b>If multiple devices (e.g., USB mouse and USB keyboard) are connected
		to the same hardware port (with the
		same interrupt vector), and one of them raises and interrupt, how does
		the CPU find out whom to serve?</b><br>
	Interrupts are only a way of requesting immediate attention by <em>some</em>
	device registered on that vector. If multiple devices are registered, the
	interrupt handler will typically ask each of them if any of them needs its
	attention (using I/O ports or memory mapped I/O).

<h2>Memory Management</h2>

Let's now continue our discussion on memory management.
<p>
Discuss malloc(), free() implementations in kernel, and at process-level.

<p>
Discuss palloc(), free() implementation in kernel.

<h2>Fragmentation</h2>
<ul>
	<li> Fragmentation within kernel data structures : use kmalloc and kfree
	<li> Fragmentation within process data structures : use process's malloc and free
	<li> Fragmentation of process address space :
	<ul>
		<li> Last time : use multiple segments (complicates programming model)
		<li> Next time : Paging
