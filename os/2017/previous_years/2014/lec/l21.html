<h1>Locking</h1>

<h2>The lock abstraction</h2>

<p>We'd like a general tool to help programmers force serialization.
There are a number of things we'd like to be able to express for
lists:

<ol>

<li>It's not enough to serialize just calls to insert(); if there's
also delete(), we want to prevent a delete() from running at the same
time as an insert().

<li>Serializing <i>all</i> calls to insert() is too much: it's
enough to serialize just calls that refer to the same list.

<li>We don't need to serialize all of insert(), just lines A and B.

</ol>

We're looking for an abstraction that gives the
programmer this kind of control. The reason to allow concurrency
when possible (items 2 and 3) is to increase performance.

<p>
While there are many coordination abstractions, locking is among the
most common.  A lock is an object with two operations:
acquire(L) and release(L). The lock has state: it is either locked
or not locked. A call to acquire(L) waits until L is not locked,
then changes its state to locked and returns. A call to release(L)
marks L as not locked.
So when you have a data structure on which
operations should proceed one at a time (i.e. not be interleaved),
associate a lock object L with the data structure and bracket the
operations with acquire(L) and release(L).

<pre>
Lock list_lock;

insert(int data){
  List *l = new List;
  l->data = data;

  acquire(&list_lock);

  l->next = list ; // A
  list = l;        // B

  release(&list_lock);
}
</pre>

How can we implement acquire() and release()?
Here is a version that <b>DOES NOT WORK</b>:

<pre> 
struct Lock {
  int locked;
}

void broken_acquire(Lock *lock) {
  while(1){
    if(lock->locked == 0){ // C
      lock->locked = 1;    // D
      break;
    }
  }
}

void release (Lock *lock) {
  lock->locked = 0;
}
</pre>

What's the problem? Two acquire()s on the same lock on different CPUs
might both execute line C, and then both execute D.  Then both will
think they have acquired the lock.  This is the same kind of race we
were trying to eliminate in insert().  But we have made a little
progress: now we only need a way to prevent interleaving in one place
(acquire()), not for many arbitrary complex sequences of code (e.g. A
and B in insert()).

<h2>Atomic instructions</h2>

We're in luck: most CPUs provide "atomic instructions" that are
equivalent to the combination of lines C and D
and prevent interleaving from other CPUs.

<p>For example, the x86 <tt>xchg %eax, addr</tt> instruction
does the following:
<ol>
<li>freeze other CPUs' memory activity for address addr
<li>temp := *addr
<li>*addr := %eax
<li>%eax = temp
<li>un-freeze other memory activity
</ol>

<p>The CPUs and memory system cooperate to ensure
that no other operations on this memory location occur
between when <tt>xchg</tt> reads and when it writes.

<p>
We can use <tt>xchg</tt> to make a correct acquire() and release()
(you can find the actual syntax in the xv6 source):

<pre>
int xchg(addr, value){
  %eax = value
  xchg %eax, (addr)
}

void acquire(Lock *lock){
  while(1){
    if(xchg(&lock->locked, 1) == 0)
      break;
  }
}

void release(Lock *lock){
  lock->locked = 0;
}
</pre>

<p>Why does this work?  If two CPUs execute <tt>xchg</tt> at the same
time, the hardware ensures that one <tt>xchg</tt> does both its steps before the
other one starts. So we can say "the first <tt>xchg</tt>" and "the second <tt>xchg</tt>".
The first <tt>xchg</tt> will read a 0 and set lock->locked to 1 and the
acquire() will return.  The second <tt>xchg</tt> will then see lock->locked as
1, and the acquire will loop.

<p>This style of lock is called a spin-lock, since acquire()
stays in a loop while waiting for the lock.

<h2>Spinning vs blocking</h2>

<p>Spin-locks are good when protecting short operations: increment a
counter, search in i-node cache, allocate a free buffer. In these
cases acquire() won't waste much CPU time spinning even if another
CPU holds the lock.

<p>Spin locks are not so great for code that has to wait for events
that might take a long time. For example, it would not be good for the
disk reading code to get a spin-lock on the disk hardware, start a
read, wait for the disk to finish reading the data, and then release the
lock.  The disk often takes 10s of milliseconds (millions of instructions)
to complete an operation.
Spinning wastes the CPU; if another process is waiting to
execute, it would be better to run that process until the disk
signals it is finished by causing an interrupt.

<p>xv6 has sleep() and wakeup() primitives that are better for
processes that need to wait for I/O.
