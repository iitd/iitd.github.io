<b>Hand-In Procedure</b>
<p>
You are to turn in this homework at the beginning of lecture. Please
write up your answers to the questions below and hand them in to a
staff member at the beginning of lecture.
<p>
-->
<b>Introduction</b>
<p>

Consider a linked list implementation. The insert code is:

<pre>
        struct list *l;
        l = list_alloc();
        l->next = list_head;
        list_head = l;
</pre>

If we run the insert on multiple processors simultaneously with no locking,
this ordering of lines can cause one of the inserts to be lost:

<pre>
        CPU1                           CPU2
       
        struct list *l;
        l = list_alloc();
        l->next = list_head;
                                       struct list *l;
                                       l = list_alloc();
                                       l->next = list_head;
                                       list_head = l;
        list_head = l;
</pre>

<p>

In this case, CPU2's new list element will be lost when CPU1
updates <code>list_head</code>.  Adding a lock that protects the final
two lines of <code>insert()</code> makes the read and write of
<code>list_head</code> atomic, so that this ordering is impossible.
<p>

The reading for this lecture includes the implementation
of <code>sleep()</code> and <code>wakeup()</code>, which processes
running in the kernel use to coordinate with each other.  Usually one
process waits for something to happen by calling <code>sleep()</code>,
and another process later indicates that the event has occured by
calling <code>wakeup()</code>. For example, a <code>read()</code> on
an empty pipe involves a <code>sleep()</code> to wait for input; a
later <code>write()</code> to the pipe calls <code>wakeup()</code>. 
<p>

One problem that the <code>sleep()</code> and <code>wakeup()</code>
implementations avoid is races in which process A has decided to sleep
but has not quite gone to sleep, at which point process B calls
<code>wakeup()</code> but doesn't see that A is sleeping and thus does not wake A
up.  If it were possible for this to occur, A would have missed the
event it was <code>sleep()</code>ing for, and its <code>sleep()</code>
might never terminate. 

<p>

Read the code with this in mind.

<p>
<b>Questions</b>
<p>
1.  How does the <code>ptable.lock</code> help avoid this problem?  Give an
ordering of instructions (like the above example for linked list
insertion)
that could result in a wakeup being missed if
the <code>ptable.lock</code> were not used. 
You need only include the relevant lines of code.
<p>

2.  <code>sleep</code> is also protected by a second lock, its second argument,
which need not be the <code>ptable.lock</code>.  Look at the example in ide.c,
which uses the <code>idelock</code>.  Give an ordering of instructions that could
result in a wakeup being missed if the <code>idelock</code> were not being used.
(Hint: this should not be the same as your answer to question 2.  The
two locks serve different purposes.)<p>

<h2>Assignment Part 2 (semaphores)</h2>
Complete the 3 exercises at the end of Chapter 5, and write down your
answers.

For the question on implementing semaphores in <code>xv6</code>,
briefly describe how you did it. Did it work?
