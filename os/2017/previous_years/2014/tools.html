<title>CSL373 / CSL633 : Operating Systems : Tools</title>
<h1><font color=blue>CSL373 / CSL633 : Operating Systems : Tools</font></h1>

This page describes how to install the tools used in the Operating Systems
class. The tools are already installed in the department cluster, so you
will need to follow these instructions if you want to do assignments on
other machines. We cannot
guarantee that these tools will run on your computer,
but they should run on recent versions of Linux.

</p><p>
It should be possible to get this development environment running
under windows with the help of 
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>.  Install cygwin, and be
sure to install the <samp>flex</samp> and <samp>bison</samp> packages
(they are under the development header).  Another alternative is to
use virtualization software like VMware and install Linux in a VM.

</p>
<!--For an overview of useful commands in the tools used in CSL373, see the
<a href="lab/labguide.html">lab tools guide</a>.-->

<h3>Compiler Toolchain</h3>

<p>Most modern Linuxes and BSDs have an ELF toolchain compatible with
the labs. That is, the system-standard <tt>gcc</tt>,
<tt>as</tt>, <tt>ld</tt> and <tt>objdump</tt> should just work.  The
lab makefile should automatically detect this.  However, if your
machine is in this camp and the makefile fails to detect this, you can
override it by adding the following line to <tt>conf/env.mk</tt>:

</p><pre>GCCPREFIX=
</pre>

<p>
If you are using something other than standard x86
Linux or BSD, you will need the GNU C compiler toolchain, configured
and built as a cross-compiler for the target
'<samp>i386-csl373-elf</samp>', as well as the GNU debugger, configured
for the <samp>i386-csl373-elf</samp> toolchain.  You can download the
specific versions we used via these links, although any recent
versions of gcc, binutils, and GDB should work:

</p><ul>
<li>	<a href="http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/binutils/binutils-2.20.1.tar.bz2">
	http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/binutils/binutils-2.20.1.tar.bz2</a>
</li><li>	<a href="http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gcc/gcc-4.5.1/gcc-core-4.5.1.tar.bz2">
	http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gcc/gcc-4.5.1/gcc-core-4.5.1.tar.bz2</a>
</li><li>	<a href="http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gdb/gdb-6.8.tar.gz">
	http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gdb/gdb-6.8.tar.gz</a>
</li></ul>


<p>Once you've unpacked these archives, run the following commands as root:

</p><pre># cd binutils-2.20.1
# ./configure --target=i386-csl373-elf --disable-nls
# make
# make install
# cd ../gcc-4.5.1
# ./configure --target=i386-csl373-elf --disable-nls --without-headers \
              --with-newlib --disable-threads --disable-shared \
              --disable-libmudflap --disable-libssp
# make
# make install
# cd ../gdb-6.8
# ./configure --target=i386-csl373-elf --program-prefix=i386-csl373-elf- \
              --disable-werror
# make
# make install
</pre>

<p>Then you'll have in <samp>/usr/local/bin</samp> a bunch of binaries
with names like <samp>i386-csl373-elf-gcc</samp>.  The lab makefile
should detect this toolchain and use it in preference to your
machine's default toolchain.  If this doesn't work, there are
instructions on how to override the toolchain inside the GNUmakefile
in the labs.


<h3>Installing QEMU</h3>
<a href=http://qemu.org>QEMU</a> is a modern and fast PC emulator.
QEMU version 1.0 is set up on the department cluster for x86 machines.
You can use GDB (or other graphical frontends) with QEMU for debugging.
If you are unable to find <code>qemu</code> on the command line, ensure that
the following is added to your <code>PATH</code> environment
variable: <code>/misc/research/teaching/sbansal/csl373/bin</code>.
<p>
We highly recommend you use a patched
version of QEMU instead of the stock version that may come
with your distribution. The version installed on the deparment
cluster is already patched. To build your own patched version of QEMU:
<ol>
	<li> Download and unpack the pre-patched 1.0 source <a href=qemu/qemu-1.0-CSL373.tar.gz>tarball</a></li>
	<li> On Linux, you may need to install the SDL development libraries to get
	a graphical VGA window. On Debian/Ubuntu, this is the <TT>libsdl1.2-dev</TT>
	package.</li>
	<li> Configure the source code:<br>
	Linux: <TT>./configure --disable-kvm [--prefix=PFX] [--target-list="i386-softmmu x86_64-softmmu"]</TT><br>
	OS X: <TT>./configure --disable-kvm --disable-sdl [--prefix=PFX] [--target-list="i386-softmmu x86_64-softmmu"]</TT><br>
	The <TT>prefix</TT> argument specifies where to install QEMU; without it
	QEMU will install to <TT>/usr/local</TT> by default. The <TT>target-list</TT>
	<li> Run <TT>make && make install</TT></li>
</ol>
Alternatively, you can download the official 0.12.5 source tarball from the
QEMU homepage and apply the following patch series:
<table>
	<tr>
		<td> <a href=qemu/patches/debug-seg>debug-seg</a></td>
		<td>Use DS-relative virtual addresses instead of linear addresses in the GDB stub.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><a href="qemu/patches/info-pg">info-pg</a></td>
		<td>Add "info pg" in the QEMU monitor that prints the page table.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><a href="qemu/patches/triple">triple</a></td>
		<td>On triple fault, dump state and halt for inspection instead of resetting.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br><br>

<h3>Installing <b>Bochs</b></h3>
<a href=http://bochs.sourceforge.net/>Bochs</a> is an open-source IA-32
emulator, and is another alternative to run your OS. Bochs comes with
a very useful internal debugger. See a local (and slightly augmented) copy of the <a href=bochs/internal-debugger.html>documentation</a> here. All additions in the local copy over the original documentation are in a different colour. The documentation is
useful for trying the commands provided in the lecture notes and book draft. The original documentation can be found <a href=http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?name=New+Bochs+Documentation&url=http://bochs.sourceforge.net/doc/docbook>here</a> (go to &quot;User Guide&quot; and
then &quot;Using Bochs internal debugger&quot;).
<p>
You can access Bochs on the department cluster by ensuring that your <code>PATH</code>
environment variable contains the following path:
<code>/misc/research/teaching/sbansal/csl373/bin</code>.
<p>
We highly recommend you use a patched version of Bochs instead of the stock
version to allow reproducible executions. The version installed on the
department cluster is already patched. There are two executables that
need to be built: <code>bochs</code> (which is compiled with
an internal debugger) and <code>bochs-gdb</code> (which is compiled with
a <code>gdb-stub</code> for debugging with <code>gdb</code>). Both
these executables have been pre-built on the department cluster.
To build your own patched version
of Bochs:
<ol>
	<li> Download and unpack the pre-patched 2.4.5 source <a href=bochs/bochs-2.4.5-CSL373.2010-12-25.tar.gz>tarball</a></li>
	<li> Configure the source code:<br>
	<TT>./configure [--prefix=/path/to/bochs-install] --enable-disasm --enable-smp --enable-debugger --enable-new-pit --enable-all-optimizations --enable-4meg-pages --disable-reset-on-triple-fault --with-all-libs --with-x --with-x11 --with-nogui</TT><br>
The X, terminal, and &quot;no GUI&quot; interfaces
can be configured, by passing <Q><SAMP>--with-x --with-x11 --with-term
--with-nogui</SAMP></Q> to <CODE>configure</CODE>.
	</li>
	<li> Run <TT>make && make install</TT></li>
	<li>This command builds the <code>bochs</code> binary with SMP support
	that can be used with both <code>xv6</code> and <code>pintos</code>. This
	bochs binary supports an internal debugger shipped with bochs.</li>
  <li>To debug pintos using gdb, you will need to build another binary.
	To do this, configure the source code in the following way:<br>
	<TT>./configure [--prefix=/path/to/bochs-gdb-install] --enable-disasm --enable-gdb-stub --enable-new-pit --enable-all-optimizations --enable-4meg-pages --disable-reset-on-triple-fault --with-all-libs --with-x --with-x11 --with-nogui</TT><br>
	Use a different prefix <code>/path/to/bochs-gdb-install</code> for the install directory to
	avoid overwriting the previous installation.
	<li> Run <TT>make && make install</TT>. This will create another
	binary called bochs in <code>/path/to/bochs-gdb-install/bin</code> directory. Go to this
	directory and rename the <code>bochs</code> executable to
	<code>bochs-gdb</code> using <code>mv bochs bochs-gdb</code>.</li>
	<li>Set your PATH variable to include both <code>/path/to/bochs-install</code> and
	<code>/path/to/bochs-gdb-install</code> directories.
</ol>
If you would like to patch and build <code>bochs</code> from
scratch (instead of using our custom tarball), you can download the
official 2.4.5 source tarball from
the Bochs homepage and apply the following patch series:
These patches are designed for use with Bochs 2.4.5:
<table>
	<tr>
		<td> <a href=bochs/patches/bochs-2.4.5-jitter.patch>jitter</a></td>
		<td>Adds the &quot;jitter&quot; feature, in which timer interrupts are
			delivered at random (but reproducible) intervals.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> <a href=bochs/patches/bochs-2.4.5-att.patch>att</a></td>
		<td>Sets the default disassembly mode to <code>AT&T</code> (also
			used in the handouts and class).</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>
To apply all the patches, <CODE>cd</CODE> into the Bochs directory, then
type:
<table>
	<tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>
			<code>patch -p1 &lt; bochs-2.4.5-jitter.patch</code>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>
			<code>patch -p1 &lt; bochs-2.4.5-att.patch</code>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
You can
use <CODE>patch</CODE>'s <Q><SAMP>--dry-run</SAMP></Q> option if you want to test
whether the patches would apply cleanly before trying to apply them.
<P>
<h3>xv6</h3>
Fetch <a href=xv6-rev6.tar.gz>xv6-rev6.tar.gz</a>. Change the first line in xv6/Makefile to:
<pre>
QEMU=/path/to/qemu-1.0-CSL373-install/bin/qemu-system-i386
</pre>
(or ensure that <code>qemu</code> is in your path).
<br>
Ensure that <code>bochs</code> is in your executable search path.
<br>
Go to the xv6 directory. Run
<pre>
make qemu
</pre>
to run xv6 inside Qemu.<br>
Run
<pre>
make bochs
</pre>
to run xv6 inside Bochs. 
Remember to type <TT>ldsym "kernel.sym"</TT> at the prompt after running
<code>make bochs</code>. This will load all the symbol to address mappings to
help you in debugging.

<h3>Other tools</h3>
A very good tool to help you browse your source code: <a href=http://cscope.sourceforge.net/>cscope</a><br>
Index your source code using <a href=http://ctags.sourceforge.net/>ctags</a><br>
Use <code>cscope/ctags</code> with vi: <a href=http://cscope.sourceforge.net/cscope_vim_tutorial.html>Vim/cscope tutorial</a>, <a href=http://oreilly.com/catalog/vi6/chapter/ch08.html#ch08_05.htm>Vim/ctags tutorial</a><br>

<h3>Subversion</h3>
Subversion (SVN) is installed on all machines in the department cluster. You
can install it on your machine using
"<code>apt-get install subversion</code>".
<br>
The <a href=http://www.cc.iitd.ernet.in/CSC>Computer Services Center</a>
provides a subversion server. To create a repository called
"<code>pintos-repo</code>":
<pre>
$ ssh ssh1.iitd.ernet.in   # use your proxy password
$ mkdir svn
$ cd svn
$ svnadmin create pintos-repo
</pre>
You should see a subdirectory called <code>pintos-repo</code>
in the <code>svn</code>
directory. Read <code>pintos-repo/README.txt</code>. Do not add, delete,
or modify any files in this subdirectory.

Edit the <code>svn/authz</code> file to
provide read-write permissions to <code>pintos-repo</code> to
yourself and your partners, and read permissions to <code>sbansal</code>.

For example, if users <code>cs1012345</code> and <code>cs1067890</code>
are partners and user <code>cs1012345</code> is currently logged in, here
is a sample authz file to use:
<pre>
[/]
[pintos-repo:/]
cs1012345@IITD.ERNET.IN = rw
cs1067890@IITD.ERNET.IN = rw
sbansal@IITD.ERNET.IN = r
</pre>
Notice that your username should be suffixed with <code>@IITD.ERNET.IN</code>
and <em>not</em> <code>cse.iitd.ernet.in</code>. These statements provide
read/write access to the group partners and read access to the instructor.
Read access to the instructor is necessary for submission of assignments.

<p>Set the directory permissions so that they look like the following:
<ul>
	<li><code>drwx-----x</code> for <code>$HOME</code>. (The permission of individual files in <code>$HOME</code> should be restricted only to the users, so that others can't peep into user's home)</li>
	<li><code>drwx------</code> for <code>$HOME/svn</code></li>
</ul>
The responsibility of maintaining the security of your repository lies with you. You will be penalized if your repository is found to be readable by other unauthorized people.

<p>Go to one of the machines in the department cluster (or your local machine).
Use the following command to checkout the files from your repository:
<pre>
$ svn checkout https://svn.iitd.ernet.in/~cs1012345/pintos-repo
</pre>
You will be prompted for your CSC password. Do not offer to save
the password in plaintext format in your home directory as that is
insecure. You can add the following line to <code>~/.subversion/servers</code>
to avoid getting prompted for saving passwords in future:
<pre>
store-plaintext-passwords = no
</pre>
This should create a directory called <code>pintos-repo</code>.
Type the following commands to add the base pintos files to the
repository:
<pre>
$ cd pintos-repo/
$ cp -r /path/to/pintos/src .
$ svn add src
$ svn commit
</pre>

"<code>svn add</code>" adds the files to your local checked-out copy of
the repository. "<code>svn commit</code>" commits the changes in your
local repository to the main repository. You will be prompted for your
CSC proxy password each time you access the main repository. At this
point, you have successfully setup your repository. Your partner
can use
<code>svn checkout https://svn.iitd.ernet.in/~cs1012345/pintos-repo</code>
to checkout a copy of the code. Just like you, your partner
is also authorized to make changes and commit
them to the main repository.

<p>If this does not work, carefully study the instructions given at the
<a href=http://www.cc.iitd.ernet.in/CSC/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=99&Itemid=126>CSC Webpage</a> on
creating, accessing, and securing your repositories. Report any missing instructions that you find to the course staff so that we can fix the documentation.

<p>Here are some more useful commands:
<ul>
	<li><code>svn status</code><br>
	Show the status of each file (whether added to the repository or not).
	</li>
	<li><code>svn add</code><br>
	Add a file to the local repository. You need to do this for any new file
	that you create since the last update. Do this for files which
	shows "<code>?</code>" in the <code>status</code> command and which you
	would like to add to the repository.
	</li>
	<li><code>svn delete</code><br>
	Delete a file from the local repository.</li>
	<li><code>svn update</code><br>
	Update the local repository with the contents of the main repository
	if they have changed since the last commit. It is possible that this
	command reports certain conflicts as your partner's changes may
	conflict with your changes. You will need to fix these conflicts
	manually.
	</li>
	<li><code>svn commit</code><br>
	Reflect the changes in your local repository to the main repository.
	You may have to do <code>svn update</code> before this if your partner
	has committed some changes after your last update. If some of your
	changes conflict with your partner's changes, you may have to resolve
	them manually and then use <code>svn resolved filename</code>.
	<li><code>svn log https://svn.iitd.ernet.in/~cs1012345/pintos-repo</code><br>
	To see the commit log
	<li><code>svn help [status|add|update|commit]</code><br>
	Get help
</ul>

Version Control Software is used in almost all modern software
development environments. Read this
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control>wikipedia article</a>
to know more about the theory. <a href=http://www.cc.iitd.ernet.in/CSC/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=99&Itemid=126>Here</a> is a brief
tutorial by the Computer Services Center on using the IITD Subversion
repository.
<a href=http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~sbansal/tut/svn-refcard.pdf>Here</a>
is a quick start document for basic SVN commands.
