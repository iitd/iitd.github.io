<h2>Process Address Spaces Using Paging</h2>
<ul>
	<li> Paging allows non-contiguous regions to be mapped in Virtual Address (VA)
	space and Physical Address (PA) space. </li>
	<li>To map a region a VA space, the page directory and page table entries at
	the corresponding offsets should be mapped. </li>
	<li>To map a region of PA space, the values in the page table entries should point
	to the corresponding physical pages. </li>
	<li>When paging is enabled, all
	addresses (including EIP, ESP, direct-addressing, etc.) go through the
	paging hardware.
	<li>Each entry in the Page Directory (PDE - page directory entry) and in the
	Page Table (PTE - page table entry) is 32-bit wide. The top 20 bits store
	a pointer (using physical address) to the page table or the page itself. The
	last 12 bits contains flags: <code>present</code>, <code>writable</code>, and
	<code>user-accessible</code>.
	<li>The final access permissions are determined by looking at the stricter
	of the permissions specified by the flags in the corresponding PDE and PTE.
	<li>CR3, PDE, and PTE contain physical addresses
	<p>
  <li>Each process has a separate page table, so a
	different address is loaded into the CR3 register on every context switch.
	<li>Also, each page table also maps the kernel into its address space
	above a certain address. This address is 0x80000000 (2GB) on xv6.
	<li>Thus the kernel is mapped at the same addresses in every page table. So,
	copies of the
	same PDEs/PTEs are present in the page directory and page tables of all process
	to map the kernel at these addresses.
	Let's call this address space region, the kernel's address space. Another way
	to put this is that each process has two halves: kernel half and user half.
	The kernel half is shared among all processes. The user half is separate. Thus
	every user process (separate address spaces) also acts as a kernel
	thread (shared address space).
	<p>
	<li>On xv6, the kernel maps the entire physical memory into its address space
	starting at 0x80000000. Thus, virtual address <code>(0x80000000+x)</code> always
	translates to physical address <code>x</code>.
	<li>The kernel's address space holds the kernel's code and the kernel's data. All
	the other space is managed as a heap (using <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>
	for example).
	<li>The kernel's heap is used to allocate memory for its own data structures
	(e.g., PCBs), processes' kernel stacks, processes' address spaces, among other
	things.
	<li>For example, if a kernel wants to allocate an address space for a process,
	it simply mallocs some space from its heap, converts the returned pointer to its
	physical address, and then creates a mapping into the process's user-side
	address space (by creating entries in its page table) so the process can access
	it in future.
	<p>
	<li>Thus every page that is accessible by the user also has a mapping in the
	kernel's address space. Thus two entries in the page table point to the same
	physical page (one in the <em>kernel-space</em>, and another in the
	<em>user-space</em>).
	<li>The Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) is setup to hold kernel pointers, i.e.,
	the CS:EIP entries are setup such that the handler runs in priviliged mode (last
	two bits of CS are zero), and EIP points to a kernel
	address (above <code>0x80000000</code>).
	<li> On a trap (due to an interrupt, exception, or system call), execution
	control transfers to the kernel's handler running in privileged mode. Because the
	kernel is mapped in every process's address space, the pointers to the handler
	(and the kernel stack of the process) in the kernel address space are always
	valid. Thus, the handler can start executing immediately on a trap, without
	requiring any address-space switch.
	<li> The kernel's handler executes the necessary logic. This sharing of address
	space between the process user-space and the kernel also allows very fast
	communication between the kernel and the user spaces. For example, if the
	user wants to provide a string argument to a system call, it can simply pass
	a pointer to the string stored in its own address space. The kernel can
	de-reference that pointer, and because the user's address space is still
	mapped, the de-referencing of the pointer will result in the
	desired data (as supplied
	by the user). Thus communication from user-space to kernel-space can be done
	only by sending a pointer - this is very fast. Recall that kernel can always
	access user pages (the user bit in PDE/PTE only prevents the user from accessing
	a kernel page).
	<li>This fast communication between the user and the kernel
	is the primary reason, why the kernel maps itself entirely in the process page
	table. Linux maps itself starting at <code>0xc0000000</code> (3GB) and Windows
	maps itself starting at <code>0x80000000</code> (2GB), but can be configured
	to map itself starting at <code>0xc0000000</code>. As already discussed,
	xv6 maps itself starting at <code>0x80000000</code>.
	<li>Because xv6 maps the entire available physical memory in the kernel space,
	there is a limit to the size of physical memory that it can support (less than
	2GB). Full operating systems (like Linux/Windows) handle this by mapping a part
	of the physical memory at all times (esp. the parts which contain kernel's code
	and data). For the other parts of the physical memory, the kernel maps and unmaps
	those regions into a VA space, to access them, depending on what needs to get
	accessed.
	<li>The page directory itself is allocated from the kernel address space
	(per process), and its
	corresponding physical address is stored in the <code>cr3</code> register when
	that process is running. Security is ensured by disallowing a process from
	accessing its own page table (by mapping the pages containing the page tables
	and page directory only in the kernel address space and not in the user address
	space).
	<li>Compare this organization to a kernel which only uses segmentation. In that
	case, a trap would switch the <code>CS</code> register (and the associated
	base and limit values of the descriptor) and thus the kernel
	would be executing in a different address space. All other segment registers
	will also be loaded with the kernel's base, so they can access the kernel's
	data. However, if the kernel wants to read an argument from the user-space
	(passed as a pointer), it
	needs to switch one of its segment registers to the user's descriptor before
	de-referencing that pointer through that segment register.
	<p>
	Notice that the kernel
	cannot simply de-reference a pointer supplied by the user in this case, as
	the address space is now different - the kernel needs to switch to user address
	space to de-reference that pointer.
	<li>Compare this organization to another paging-based organization of
	the kernel, where the
	entire kernel is not mapped into the process address space, but only a small
	slice of the kernel address
	space (which stores the trap handler and the kernel stack) is mapped in the
	process address space. In this case, the trap handler will switch to the kernel's
	page table and then execute the kernel's logic in a different address space
	(by switching to a different page table).
	However, if the kernel needs to de-reference a user pointer, it cannot do so.
	In this case, the trap handler should also de-reference all user pointers and
	copy them into its space before switching to the kernel's address space.

	<p>Because transitions between user and kernel require page table switches,
	and because the kernel cannot access user memory directly in this organization (
	the trap handler needs to copy portions of user memory for the kernel to read),
	this organization is relatively more complex and less performant.

<h2>Bootup : Executing the first instruction after power-on</h2>
Switching on your computer, makes it start from a clean state, where memory
contents are completely uninitialized. Only the disk contains state that persists
across power cycles. The x86 architecture specifies that when a computer is
powered-on, the first block (or sector) on disk will be read and its contents pasted
at address <code>0x7c00</code>, and control will be transferred to the instruction
at its first byte (address <code>0x7c00</code>). Recall that the x86 architecture
boots in 16-bit mode, with no paging. Also, the segmentation hardware in 16-bit
mode simply multiplies the segment register's value by 16 and
adds it to the virtual address to obtain a physical address.

<p>
A disk block (or sector) is sized at 512 bytes. Thus the machine reads the 512
bytes in the first block and pastes them at addresses <code>0x7c00-0x7e00</code>
and transfers control to <code>0x7c00</code>. This code, which must fit in
512 bytes then loads the kernel from the disk (it must know the location of the
kernel on disk) and pastes it into memory (it must know the location in memory
where it needs to be pasted), before transferring control to it.
