<h3>Assignment Part 3 (context switch)</h3>
When one xv6 process switches to another, two calls to swtch()
are involved: one from sched() to
scheduler(), and one from scheduler() to sched(). Bugs Bunny
suggests eliminating one of the calls: sched() could call
a variant of scheduler() directly. The new code:
<pre>
// caller must hold proc_table_lock.
void
sched(void)
{
  scheduler2();
}
// caller must hold proc_table_lock.
void
scheduler2(void)
{
  struct proc *p;
  struct proc *from = cp; // remember who we are
  int i;
  for(;;){
    for(i = 0; i < NPROC; i++){
      p = &proc[i];
      if(p->state != RUNNABLE)
        continue;
      cp = p;
      setupsegs(p);
      p->state = RUNNING;
      swtch(&from->context, &p->context);
      // a return from swtch() means some other call to
      // scheduler2() decided to run us.
      cp = from;
      setupsegs(cp);
      return;
    }
    release(&proc_table_lock);
    acquire(&proc_table_lock);
  }
}
</pre>
This new swtch()-less sched() works most of the time, but not always. What is likely to go wrong?

<h3>Assignment Part 4 (fork)</h3>
In the function <code>fork()</code>, why do we need to
store <code>pid</code>
in a temporary stack variable [2282]?
