This homework is based on the ZCAV tool: see ZCAV documentation <a href=http://www.coker.com.au/bonnie++/zcav/>here</a>.

<h3>Background</h3>
Given constant rotational speed
(<em>constant angular velocity, CAV</em>) of a magnetic disk, the head can cover larger
distance on the outer tracks in the same time, compared to the inner
tracks.
If the sector density on all tracks is same, this would cause space
wastage on the outer tracks (as their density would be limited by the inner
tracks).

<p>To deal with this situation, modern disks divide their tracks into
<em>zones</em>. The inner zones have lower angular sector density, while the outer
zones have higher angular sector density. Effectively, this means that the disk
throughput at the outer zones is higher. This is also called
<em>zoned constant angular velocity</em> (ZCAV).

<p>To take advantage of this, the disk controllers usually map the
lower sector numbers (starting from sector number zero) on the outer
tracks, while the higher sector numbers are mapped to inner tracks. The
thinking being that the lower sector numbers are likely to have higher
frequency of access. Notice that this is just an assumption and may not
be true!

<p>ZCAV program measures the disk throughput at different sector
numbers. To do this, it reads/writes 256MB (default) worth of data starting
at sector <code>X</code>, where <code>X</code> is varied from 0 to disk-size.

<p>You can see the results of running ZCAV on some disk configurations
<a href=http://www.coker.com.au/bonnie++/zcav/results.html>here</a>.

<h4>Turn in</h4>
Run ZCAV using the following command for the following types of disks:
<ul>
	<li>A disk on a physical desktop in GCL. We will provide you with root
	access on one of the desktops to perform this experiment.
	<li>A disk on a physical laptop (optional). If you have a laptop, report
	its make and model, and published disk characteristics (seek, latency,
	throughput). Then measure it using ZCAV and report. Also, report any
	interesting conclustions (if any). This part is optional; if you do not
	have access to a laptop, you are not required to do this part.
	<li>A USB (pen) drive. Report the make, model, and published characteristics
	of the USB drive and compare with your obtained results.
	<li>A disk mounted inside a Virtual Machine (VM).
	We ran the experiment on a Baadal VM ourselves and here is the raw data
	we obtained for two disks (main disk containing the OS image of 80GB size,
	and an attached disk of 8GB size): <a href=main_80GB.txt>main_80GB.txt</a>,
	<a href=attached_8GB.txt>attached_8GB.txt</a>. You can answer this part by
	either interpreting this raw data, or generating data for yourself. Here
	are the credentials required to access the Baadal VM:
	<pre>
  IP address: 172.16.3.16
  user: root
  password: zcav123
  </pre>
	To access this VM, you will first have to login to baadalcsegateway.cse.iitd.ernet.in
	using your GCL credentials, and then SSH to 172.16.3.16 from there.<br>
	The VM has 8 CPUs, and 8GB RAM, and a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qcow>qcow2-format mounted disk</a>. You may want to read a bit about how VMs are implemented 
  (in particular, how disks are virtualized and how the qcow2 format works) to
	answer this question.
</ul>
Report all results as graphs as at this <a href=http://www.coker.com.au/bonnie++/zcav/results.html>URL</a>. Feel free to use the GNUPlot scripts available
at this URL (e.g., <a href=command.gnuplot.zcav>command.gnuplot.zcav</a>).
In particular, how many zones do you find? What is the mapping between
sector numbers and physical disk layout? What are the corresponding
disk bandwidths? Anything else you notice?

Finally, explain the different behaviour in different environments.

<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Downloading and Installing: download this <a href=bonnie++-1.03e.tgz>tarball</a>, and type the following commands:
	<ul>
		<li><pre>tar xzf bonnie++-1.03e.tgz</pre></li>
	  <li><pre>cd bonnie++-1.03e</pre>
		<li><pre>./configure</pre>
		<li><pre>make</pre>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Running</b>: <code>sudo ./zcav /dev/sda</code> (replace <code>sda</code> with <code>sdb</code>, <code>hda</code>, etc. depending on the disk being tested).
  <li>You only need to test the read performance (not write).
	<li>You may first want to setup the experiment on your private machine
	before experimenting on GCL. Note that one experiment can take hours to
	complete, so plan in advance on accessing the GCL machine.
	<li>While zcav is running, you may want to check that your CPU is not
	bottlenecked (i.e., utilization is below 100\%) using <code>top</code>.
	Also, you may want to check that no other IO-intensive operation is running
	using <code>iotop</code>.
</ul>

<h3>Fun</h3>
This part is optional. If you do these, feel free to submit your results.
<ul>
<li>Can you modify the ZCAV program to estimate the seek and latency of
the magnetic disk? How? What were your results?
<li>Try the same experiments for writes (instead of reads). Do your results
differ? For which environments? Why? Warning: writes will overwrite your
filesystem and can potentially make the FS unusable. So any write
experiments should not be done on the disk containing the current FS.
<li>Try the same experiments on <em>filesystems</em> (instead of raw
disks as above). Here, you would need to create a large file, and then
use the command:<code>./zcav filename</code>.
<ul>
<li>Try for different filesystems and different FS options: in particular,
try for ext4 ordered mode vs. ext4 default mode.
</ul>
</ul>

<!--
Download IOmeter from <a href=http://www.iometer.org>www.iometer.org</a> and estimate the seek time, the rotational delay, and the disk transfer time of your laptop/desktop using varying sizes of workloads. Compare your estimates with the published numbers for your disk (by the manufacturer). Submit a written description of what you tried, and what were your results

<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Download the source tarball (not binary tarballs), and untar it.
	<li>Ensure that you have the following packages installed (on Ubuntu)
	<ul>
		<li><pre>sudo apt-get install libaio1</pre>
		<li><pre>sudo apt-get install libaio-dev</pre>
	</ul>
	If you are performing this experiment on a GCL machine, request updaters@cse
	to install these packages (if not already installed).
	<li>Type <pre>cd src &amp;&amp; make -f Makefile-Linux.x86_64 all</pre>. (If you are on 32-bit system, use  <pre>cd src &amp;&amp; make -f Makefile-Linux.i386 all</pre>
</ul>
