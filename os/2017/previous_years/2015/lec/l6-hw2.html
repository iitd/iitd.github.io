<h1>Practice Questions: processes and threads</h1>

<!-- <p>This lecture covers scheduling policies of threads and processes.
Recall that a process is an abstraction which includes a program
counter, registers, and an address space which includes the code,
static data, stack and the heap. Threads are abstractions similar
to processes except that multiple threads can share the same
address space. Each thread has it's own program counter, registers
and stack. Threads can share code, static data, and heap. Threads
take significantly less space than processes because they don't require
separate address spaces.<br><br>

<b>Hand-In Procedure</b>
<p>
You are to turn in this homework during lecture. Please
write up your answers to the exercises below and hand them in to a
staff member at the beginning of lecture. Mention your CSE login
ID at the top of your homework submission.

<p><h2>Assignment Part 1 (Threads)</h2></p>
Threads can be implemented completely at the user level. i.e., we do
not require privileged operations to implement a thread abstraction
and schedule different threads. In other words, a process can provide
multiple threads by implementing a scheduler. Let's see how this
can be done.

<p>To implement threads, the process needs to provide the abstraction
of multiple control-flow (program counter), multiple register
sets and multiple stacks. This can be done if after every periodic
time interval, one thread can be interrupted and saved and another
thread can be loaded. Saving a thread involves saving it's program
counter, registers and stack pointer. Similarly, loading a thread
involves loading the new thread's program counter, registers and stack
pointer. Neither the save operation, nor the load operation requires
any privileged operation -- we are just loading and saving registers.

<p>So the only remaining issue is how to periodically interrupt a
running thread from within a process. For an OS, this interruption
is done by the hardware timer device. A process can do this using
the SIGALRM signal.

<p>Such threads implemented inside a process are called user-level
threads. The OS cannot distinguish between multiple user-level threads
and it can only see one process that is running which includes the
thread scheduler and the different threads. 

<p><b>Turn in:</b><br>
Read the manpage of
the <code>signal</code>, <code>alarm</code>, and <code>setitimer</code>.
Understand how SIGALRM can
help in implementing user-level threads. Briefly describe how you
will do this (2-3 sentences and some pseudo-code).

<h3>Assignment Part 2 (Zombies)</h3>
In UNIX, a child process may terminate before a parent calls
<code>wait()</code>. When the parent calls <code>wait()</code> eventually,
it still expects to read the correct exitcode that the child returned.
To support this functionality, UNIX does not completely remove the process
till it's parent has called <code>wait()</code> on it.

<p>
Such processes that have completed execution but still have an entry
in the process table are called <em>zombie processes</em>. Usually,
the presence of zombie processes in the system for a long time indicates
a bug in the program (it is a common error).

<p>
Read about Zombie process at this <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_process>wikipedia article</a>. Also read about the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIGCHLD>SIGCHLD</a> signal.

<p>
<b>Turn in:</b><br>
In class we discussed that the shell implements "<code>&</code>" functionality
by not calling <code>wait()</code> immediately. Should the shell
never call <code>wait()</code>? When should it call
<code>wait()</code>? Answer by providing short pseudo-code.
