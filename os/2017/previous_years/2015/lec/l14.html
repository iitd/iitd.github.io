	<h2>Loading the kernel, Initializing the page table</h2>
<h3>Loading the kernel</h3>
<ul>
	<li>So far, we have looked at the first few instructions, written in assembly,
	to initialize 32-bit mode, segment registers, stack pointer, and a call to the
	C function <code>bootmain</code>.
	<li><code>bootmain</code> is not supposed to return (it is supposed to 
	load the kernel and jump into it). However, it may return if an error was
	observed during the loading process. In which case, the code following
	the <code>call</code> instruction executes some instructions which allow
	a user to debug the error.
	<li>The <code>bootmain</code> function (on Sheet 85) will read the kernel
	image (stored in ELF format) from the disk, load its program segments into
	physical memory, and branch to its first instruction.
	<li>The xv6 disk has the kernel image starting at sector no. 1 (second sector on disk).
	(Recall that sector no. 0 was the boot sector).
	<li>ELF is a standard format used to represent executable and object files.
	In this case, we use this format for the kernel. Typically, the OS loader loads
	an executable by parsing the ELF file. In this case, the "bootloader" will load
	the kernel by parsing the ELF formatted data stored in disk blocks (starting at
	disk block 1).
	<li>ELF Format: The
	first few bytes contain the ELF header, which must have a fixed "magic"
	number at a fixed offset (to confirm that it is indeed a valid ELF file), and should
	have a pointer to the "program headers" which store information
	about "program segments". Each program header represents a program
	segment (e.g., code, data, etc.).
	Also, the ELF header will store the number of
	program segments (or headers).
	<li>Each program header contains the following information:
	<ul>
		<li><code>offset</code>: the file offset at which the program segment is in the
		file (or on the disk).
		<li><code>filesz</code>: the size of the program segment in the file
		<li><code>paddr</code>: the physical address at which the segment should be
		loaded.
		<li><code>vaddr</code>: the virtual address at which the segment should be
		loaded.
		<li><code>memsz</code>: the size of the program segment in memory. This must
		be greater than <code>filesz</code>. If <code>memsz</code> is not equal
		to <code>filesz</code>, the remaining <code>(memsz - filesz)</code> bytes
		in the segment are initialized to zero by the loader.
	</ul>
	<li>On Linux, type <code>man elf</code> to get full details about the ELF format.
	<li>Let's get back to the code in <code>bootmain.c</code>. Line 8527
	makes a call to <code>readseg()</code> to read
	the first few bytes starting at disk sector 1 (notice the disk sector computed at
	line 8589 starts at sector 1) into a memory area named by the variable
	<code>elf</code>.
	<li>The <code>elf</code> variable is treated as an ELF header and its values
	are read (e.g., <code>magic</code> field, <code>phoff</code> field to obtain
	the location of program headers, <code>phnum</code> field to obtain the number
	of program headers).
	<li>The loop in lines 8536-8541 iterates over the program headers, and loads the
	program segment corresponding to each program header from disk to memory.
	<li>The call to <code>readseg()</code> in line 8538 loads <code>ph.filesz</code>
	bytes from disk at offset <code>ph.off</code> and stores them at <em>physical
		address</em> <code>ph.paddr</code>.
	<li>Recall that because we are currently working with physical memory (paging has
	not yet been enabled), the bootloader uses the physical address in the program
	header (<code>paddr</code>) to load the corresponding segment.
	<li>The lines 8539-8540 check if <code>ph.memsz</code> is greater than
	<code>ph.filesz</code>, and if so, zeroes out the remaining bytes (as required).
	<li>Finally, the ELF header also contains the starting instruction address in
	the <code>entry</code> field, to which the bootloader makes a function
	call at line 8546. At this point the control has shifted from the bootloader to
	the first instruction in the kernel.
	<li>To understand exactly what is happening, type the following command to
	look inside the kernel ELF file:
	<pre>
  xv6$ objdump -p kernel
  Program Header:
    LOAD off    0x00001000 vaddr 0x80100000 paddr 0x00100000 align 2**12
         filesz 0x0000b596 memsz 0x000126fc flags rwx
   STACK off    0x00000000 vaddr 0x00000000 paddr 0x00000000 align 2**2
         filesz 0x00000000 memsz 0x00000000 flags rwx
  </pre>
	The first segment is supposed to be loaded from offset <code>0x1000</code>, at
	virtual address <code>0x80100000</code>, physical address <code>0x100000</code>.
	Its size in the file is <code>0xb596</code> bytes, and its size in memory is
	<code>126fc</code> bytes.
	<p>
	The second segment indicates a stack segment, and we can ignore it for now.
	<li>Thus the kernel has only one relevant segment that is loaded at physical
	address of 1MB (0x100000) and virtual address of KERNBASE + 1MB (0x80100000).
	KERNBASE is the starting address of the kernel's address space (0x80000000 or 2GB
	in xv6).
	<li> Why load at paddr 0x100000? that's 1MB. Why not 0x0? there are memory-mapped
	devices at physical address less than 1MB. Why not 2MB? that would work
	too but that may waste more physical memory space.
	<li>To see the starting instruction address of the kernel, type the
	following command:
	<pre>
xv6$ objdump -f kernel

kernel:     file format elf32-i386
architecture: i386, flags 0x00000112:
EXEC_P, HAS_SYMS, D_PAGED

start address 0x0010000c
  </pre>
	Notice that the start address is a physical address (and deliberately
	so). This is correct because
	at the time of branching to the start address, we are still operating
	in the physical address space.
	<li>All other symbols in the kernel are assigned virtual addresses
	(above KERNBASE).
</ul>
<h3>Initializing the page table</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The first few instructions in the kernel (<code>entry.S</code>)
	execute from physical address space and initialize the page table and
	enable paging. After paging is enabled, the kernel will start executing from
	virtual address space.
  <li>Ignore lines 1042-1044. They enable large pages in the hardware
	<li>Lines 1046-1047 load a page directory into cr3. The contents of the
	page directory are provided in a global array
	called <code>entrypgdir</code>. <code>entrypgdir</code> 
	is assigned a virtual address (like all other kernel variables). Thus
	the code converts it into a physical address (by subtracting KERNBASE
	from it using V2P_WO macro) before loading it into <code>cr3</code>
	register (as <code>cr3</code> needs a physical address).
	<li>Let's look at <code>entrypgdir</code> defined at Sheet 13.
	<code>entrypgdir</code> is an array of 1024 <code>pde_t</code>
	entries. In this case, all other entries are set to zero (which means
	the corresponding pages are not present), except the first
	entry (entry #0) and the <code>(KERNBASE >> PDXSHIFT)</code>'th
	entry (entry #512) which both point to the same
	first 4MB page in the physical
	address space. Notice that these are the only two
	entries where the present bit (indicated by PTE_P) is set.
	Also, notice that both entries use large pages and allow writes.
	<li>As soon as paging is enabled (line 1051), the address space changes, and it
	is possible that the program counter <code>EIP</code> may now point
	to a different byte. To avoid this, the kernel developer has carefully
	used an identity mapping for the first 4MB, i.e., the first 4MB of VA
	space (virtual address space) map to the first 4MB of PA space
	(physical address space). Through
	this, the developer ensures that
	the current execution addresses will remain
	valid even after paging is enabled (all these addresses are less than
	4MB by design).
	<li>Also, the size of the kernel (code and data) is less than 4MB, so
	this ensures that the kernel is fully mapped in the virtual address space
	at their corresponding physical addresses,
	even after paging is enabled.
	<li>Moreover, the first 4MB of the physical address space is also
	mapped at virtual address KERNBASE (from KERNBASE to KERNBASE+4MB) in
	this address space. The next few instructions will re-initialize the
	stack and the program counter to virtual addresses, and the kernel
	will operate in the virtual address space from there on (leaving the
	bottom 2GB of virtual address space for user processes).
	<li>Line 1054 pushes the value of the <code>stack</code> variable into
	<code>esp</code>. Note that this will be a virtual address value (greater
	than KERNBASE), just like all other variables in the kernel. Because the
	address space in that region is mapped, this value will point to a valid address.
	<li>Finally, lines 1060-1061 branch to <code>main</code>, which is also a
	virtual address (greater than KERNBASE). After this instruction, the execution
	remains in virtual address mode.
	<li>Notice that the kernel used a temporary page table (<code>entrypgdir</code>)
	to switch from the physical address space to the virtual address space. This
	temporary page table had both
	physical-side mappings (0-4MB) and virtual-side mappings (KERNBASE to KERNBASE+4MB)
	for the same physical addresses (0-4MB). This allowed transitioning from one
	address space to another.
	<li>After the transition has taken place, the kernel will install a new page
	table which will only have virtual-side mappings. All virtual addresses below
	KERNBASE will be used for user processes from there on.
	<li>Let's look at the <code>main()</code> function at line 1217. This function
	initializes the physical memory, page tables, I/O devices, and other things, before
	initializing the first user process (line 1239) and
	going into an infinite scheduling loop thereafter (which schedules the available
	processes). Because xv6 is a multiprocessor OS, the first CPU that has booted
	also initializes the other CPUs in the system (line 1237).
