<p><h2>Assignment Part 4 (pintos submissions)</h2>
You should have submitted Lab1 by now using <code>os-submit-lab1</code> script.
<p>
You should now download the <code>pintos</code> source code
<a href=../pintos/doc/pintos.tar.gz>here</a>.
Next, you should submit the base version of pintos
using <code>os-submit-pintos</code> script (we need that you submit the base
version to be able to correctly submit your next lab). You will need to
create a Subversion repository for yourself to do this. See
instructions on the <a href=../tools.html>tools</a> page for instructions
on using Subversion.

<p>On successful submission, you should have seen a "Congratulations"
message with your submission ID if your submission
was successful. At any time, you can check if your submission
has been made by typing
"<code>os-get-submission <user-id> base</code>". For
future assignments just replace <code>base</code>
with <code>userprog</code>, <code>vm</code>, etc.
The <code>os-get-submission</code> script should
create a directory with your submission-id. This directory
should contain a <code>submit.note</code> file.

<p>You should build your solution to Lab2 (<code>userprog</code>)
on top of the base pintos version that you submitted. We
encourage you to use the
SVN repository actively during development. Use good and
illustrative commit messages. We will examine your repository
log during demos.

<p>Study the grading policy on the
<a href=../administrivia.html>Administrivia</a> page. You
can check your current score using <code>os-score</code>
script. In case of multiple submissions by the
same person/group, we will use the date
of your <em>last</em>
submission to compute the late days. Notice that
late days are counted at the granularity of hours.
So if you are late by 4 hours for <code>Lab1</code>
and late by 5 hours for <code>Lab2</code>, your total late "days" is
only 9 hours (not 2 days).
Nothing to turn in for this part.-->
