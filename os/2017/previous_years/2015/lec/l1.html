<h1>Introduction to UNIX System Calls</h1>

<h2>Outline</h2>
<ul>
<li>System Calls: fork, exec, exit, wait, open, read, write, close
<li>Case Study: Unix/xv6 shell (simplified)
</ul>

<h2>System Calls</h2>
<ul>
	<li>"Kernel functions" that perform privileged operations on behalf
of the process. As an OS designer, one of the goals is to minimize the
system call interface.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Case study: Unix/xv6 shell (simplified)</h2>

<ul>
<li>provides an interactive command execution and programming language
<li>typically handles login session, runs other processes
<li>look at some simple examples of shell operations, how they
    use different OS abstractions, and how those abstractions
    fit together.
    See <a href="../bib/ritchie74unix.pdf">Unix paper</a>
    if you are unfamiliar with the shell.
<li>Basic structure:
<pre>
	while (1) {
	    write (1, "$ ", 2);			// 1 = STDOUT_FILENO
	    readcommand (0, command, args);	// parse user input, 0 = STDIN_FILENO
	    if ((pid = fork ()) == 0) {		// child?
		exec (command, args, 0);
	    } else if (pid > 0) {		// parent?
		wait (0);			// wait for child to terminate
	    } else {
		perror ("Failed to fork\n");
	    }
	}
</pre>
<li>system calls: <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>,
	<code>fork</code>, <code>exec</code>, <code>wait</code>.
    conventions: -1 return value signals error,
    error code stored in <code>errno</code>,
    <code>perror</code> prints out a descriptive error
    message based on <code>errno</code>.
<li>What's the shell doing?
    fork, exec, wait: process diagram
    (PID, address space -- memory of the process, parent links).
    fork returns twice, in some sense!
<li>why call "wait"?  to wait for the child to terminate and collect
    its exit status.  (if child finishes, child becomes a zombie until
    parent calls wait.)

<li>Example:
<pre>
	$ ls
</pre>
<li>how does ls know which directory to look at? (cwd variable is copied during fork)
<li>how does it know what to do with its output? (fd[1] is initialized by the shell)
<li>I/O: process has file descriptors, numbered starting from 0.
<li>system calls: open, read, write, close

<li>numbering conventions:
<ul>
<li>file descriptor 0 for input (e.g., keyboard). read_command: 
<pre>
     read (0, buf, bufsize)
</pre>
<li>file descriptor 1 for output (e.g., terminal)
<pre>
     write (1, "hello\n", strlen("hello\n"))
</pre>
<li>file descriptor 2 for error (e.g., terminal)
</ul>
<li>on fork, child inherits open file descriptors from parent (show in
    process diagram).
<li>on exec, process retains file descriptors, except those specifically
    marked as close-on-exec: <code>fcntl(fd, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC)</code>

<li>How does the shell implement:
<pre>
     $ ls > tmp1
</pre>
just before exec insert:
<pre>
	close(1);
	creat("tmp1", 0666);   // fd will be 1
</pre>
<p>The kernel always uses the first free file descriptor, 1 in this case.
    Could use <code>dup2()</code> to clone a file descriptor to a new number.

<li>Good illustration for why fork + exec vs. CreateProcess on Windows.
    (CreateProcess takes 10 arguments.)
