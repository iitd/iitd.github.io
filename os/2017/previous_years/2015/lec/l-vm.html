<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>
what's a virtual machine?
  accurate simulation of a computer (like Bochs)
  directly on the real computer's CPU + memory (faster than Bochs)
why use a VM?
  one computer, multiple operating systems (OSX and Windows)
  development environment (like Bochs)
  better fault isolation: contain break-ins
  manage big machines (allocate CPUs/memory at o/s granularity)
  simplify o/s development (Disco)
Disco led to VMware, which started modern popularity of VMs
terminology
  guest o/s vs VMM
  virtual state vs real state
want to execute guest instructions on real CPU when possible
  works fine for most instructions
  e.g. add %eax, %ebx
  here there's no separate virtual %eax, just using real registers
  fast!
why not load JOS into a user-space process on Linux and run it?
  _start executes lgdt
    would modify *real* state
    but DPLs in guest descriptors have DPL=0 -- would crash since CPL=3
    luckily lgdt forbidden when cpl=3 => trap to VMM
    VMM might copy GDT somewhere, fix DPLs, lgdt on shadow copy
this is the basic technique for making VMs
  need to have virtual state != physical state
  trap on instructions that write / read real state
  VMM translates, executes real instruction
</pre>

<h2>Virtualizing the x86</h2>
<pre>
how could we virtualize the x86?
  like VMware, Parallels, Microsoft Virtual PC
how shall we give guest illusion of physical memory?
  can't allow direct access, but must look like mem from PA=0..size
  use some range of real phys mem
  real page table will map 0..size to that range
what CPL should we use for guest o/s?
  can't use 0: we can't get traps for e.g. lgdt
  can't use 1 or 2: can then read any page (e.g. VMM's pages)
  so guest o/s AND user programs at CPL=3
what real state do we have to hide (i.e. != virtual state)?
  real physical memory
  CPL (low bits of CS) since it is 3, guest expecting 0
  gdt descriptors (DPL 3, not 0)
  gdtr (pointing to shadow gdt)
  idt descriptors (traps go to VMM, not guest o/s)
  idtr
  pagetable (doesn't map to expected physical addresses)
  %cr3 (points to shadow pagetable)
  control flags: IF &c in EFLAGS, %cr0, &c
can we hide the real state from the guest?
  do all instructions that read/write sensitive state cause traps?
  push %cs will show CPL=3, not 0
  sgdt reveals real GDTR
  pushf pushes real IF
    suppose guest turned IF off
    VMM will leave real IF on, just defer interrupts to guest
  popf ignores IF if CPL=3, no trap
    so VMM won't know if guest o/s wants interrupts
  IRET no ring change so won't restore restore SS/ESP 
how can we cope with non-trapping instructions that reveal real state?
  rewrite guest code, change them to INT 3, which traps
  keep track of original instruction, emulate in VMM
  INT 3 is one byte, so doesn't change code size/layout
how does rewriter know where instruction boundaries are?
  or whether bytes are code or data?
  scan only as executed, since execution reveals instr boundaries
  original start of kernel (making up these instructions):
  entry:
    pushl %ebp
    ...
    popf
    ...
    jnz x
    ...
    jxx y
  x:
    ...
    jxx z
  when VMM first loads guest kernel, translate from entry to first jump
    replace bad instrs (popf) with int3
    replace jump with int3
    then start the guest kernel
  on int3 trap to VMM
    look where the jump could go (now we know the boundaries)
    for each branch, xlate until first jump again
    replace int3 w/ original branch
    re-start
  keep track of what we've translated, so we don't do it again
indirect jumps?
  same, but probably can't replace with a real jump
  since we're not sure address will be the same next time
  so must take a trap every time
what if guest reads or writes its own code?
  can't set up PTE for X but no R
  perhaps make CS != DS
  put translated code in CS
  put original code in DS
  write-protect original code pages
  on write trap
    emulate write
    find all jumps to modified code
    re-translate starting at those entry points
VMware avoids many faults 
  re-writing w/ VMM code, rather than int3
  often faster than non-VM o/s, e.g. cli vs setting a flag in virt state
  but then code size and fn addresses change
  how does VMware hide e.g. return EIPs?
do we need to rewrite guest user-level code?
  technically yes: SGDT, IF
  but probably not in practice
  user code only does INT, which traps to VMM
how to handle pagetable?
  VMM must modify phys addrs in PTEs
  simple plan:
    trap on writes to %cr3
    copy entire page table to VMM memory: shadow pagetable
    fix the phys addrs in PTEs
    load %cr3 to point to shadow pagetable
  what if guest o/s writes a PTE?
    must immediately be reflected to real pagetable
    VMM must write-protect guest's PTE pages
  what if too slow to scan entire pagetable after every %cr3 load?
    i.e. on every process switch
  could start w/ empty real page table (just VMM mappings)
    look at guest pagetable on demand, driven by page faults
  could cache entire page tables
    guest o/s probably switching among fairly static per-process tables
    VMM could learn where they are in guest memory
  nasty tradeoff
    if you pre-compute/cache, fault for every guest table write
    if lazy, lots of page faults to populate shadow pagetable
  need to reflect dirty/accessed bits back to guest pagetable
    when? how lazy can we be?
    could take a trap on first read and first write of each data page
    could take a trap on guest o/s reads of its page table
  how to guard guest kernel against writes by guest programs?
    both are at CPL=3
    delete kernel PTEs on IRET, re-install on INT?
what shall we do about devices?
  trap INB and OUTB
  DMA addresses are physical, VMM must translate and check
  rarely makes sense for guest to use real device
    want to share w/ other guests
    each guest gets a part of the disk
    each guest looks like a distinct Internet host
    each guest gets an X window
  VMM might mimic some standard ethernet or disk controller
    regardless of actual h/w on host computer
  or guest might run special drivers that jump to VMM
