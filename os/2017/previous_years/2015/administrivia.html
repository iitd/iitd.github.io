<h3> Grading </h3>
Homeworks / Quizzes: 9 (best three out of four, 3 marks each)<br>
Minor1: 16<br>
Minor2: 17<br>
Labs: 27 (2 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 5) <br><!--(best three out of four, 8 each)<br>-->
Major: 31<br>
Total: 100<br>

<p>For labs, you will be allowed a total
of <em>10 free late days</em>. i.e.,
you can submit your assignment late without penalty provided you
stay within your budget of late days. After you exceed your budget
of free late days, you will be penalized at the rate of 1 mark per
day. i.e., if your assignment had a weight of 7 and you
have a late day penalty of 2 marks, you will be evaluated out of
5 for that assignment. The late
penalty for any single assignment will never exceed 3 marks. If you
submit late, you are responsible for scheduling your demo with the
TA. If you are unable to schedule your demo, your submission will
not be counted. The accounting of late days will be done at the granularity
of one hour.

We will provide enough time for you to work on your
assignments and advise you to use these late days judiciously to cover
unforeseen/emergency situations. <i>No other request for deadline extension
will be entertained</i>

<p>Exams will be open book, open notes. You must bring with you
the <code>xv6</code> code listing to the exams as questions
may be asked on it.

<p>To know your current score in the course, logon to
<code>palasi.cse.iitd.ernet.in</code> and type <code>os-score</code><br>

<h3>Regrading Policy</h3>
If you are dissatisfied with your grade in any of the homeworks,
lab-evaluations, or exams, you can submit it for "regrading".
You should give us a written
note explaining which question(s) you think were incorrectly evaluated
and why you think so, along with your corrected manuscript. If we find
merit in your concerns, we will address them. On the other hand, if we
find your regrading request to be frivolous, you will incur a penalty
of 1 mark.
Your regrading request for an assignment should be received within
15 calendar days of the return of answer scripts.

<p>Also, if you ask us to regrade a submission, we can regrade other
questions (apart from the one that you point out) in that submission too.

<h3>Academic Integrity Code</h3>
<b>Academic honesty is required in all your work</b>. Verbal discussion of
assignments is fine but looking at someone else's work and then doing your is
not. You must do all written and programming assignments on your own, except
where group work is explicitly authorised. If you use parts of a solution or code from other sources (such as Internet, other OSes, etc.), you should explicitly mention it in your submission. <b>Letting your work become available
  or visible to others is also cheating</b>. The first instance of cheating will
straight-away invite an 'F' grade in the course and a referral to the disciplinary committee.
