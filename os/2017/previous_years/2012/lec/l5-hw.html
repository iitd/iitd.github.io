<h1>Homework: Processes, Interrupts, Exceptions, Context Switch</h1>

<p>
<b>Hand-In Procedure</b>
<p>
You are to turn in this homework at the beginning of lecture.
Please write up your answers to the exercises below and hand them in to a
staff member at the beginning of the lecture. <b>Write your CSE login ID at
	the top of your submission</b>
<p>

<h3>Assignment Part 1 (traps)</h3>

xv6 defines two structures that hold saved registers for a process: struct
trapframe on sheet 05, and struct context on sheet 15. Explain a situation in which a single
process will have three sets of saved registers.

<p>
Some traps push an extra error code onto the stack (see Table 5-1 and Figure 5-3 from <a href=http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~sbansal/csl373/ref/ia32-3.pdf>Volume 3</a>). But this error code isn't pushed
by the INT instruction. Can the user confuse the kernel by invoking
"<code>INT 0xc</code>" (or any other vector that usually pushes an error
code)? Why not?


<h3>Assignment Part 2 (context switching)</h3>
<p>
<b>Read</b>: swtch.S and proc.c (focus on the code that switches
between processes, specifically <code>scheduler</code> and <code>sched</code>).
Also process creation: sys_fork() and copyproc().

<p>
In this part of the homework you will investigate how the
kernel switches between
two processes. 

<p>
<b>Assignment</b>:
<p>

Suppose a process that is running in the kernel
calls <code>sched()</code>, which ends up jumping
into <code>scheduler()</code>.

<p>
<b>Turn in</b>: 
Where is the stack that <code>sched()</code> executes on?

<p>
<b>Turn in</b>: 
Where is the stack that <code>scheduler()</code> executes on?

<p>
<b>Turn in:</b>
When <code>sched()</code> calls <code>swtch()</code>,
does that call to <code>swtch()</code> ever return? If so, when?

<p>
Now think back to <a href="../lec/l2.html">lecture 2</a> and the invariants
that gcc expects any function, including <code>swtch</code>, to
maintain.  Compare these invariants with what <code>swtch</code>
actually implements, and the state that our kernel maintains in
a <code>struct context</code>.

<p>
<b>Turn in</b>: Could <code>swtch</code> do less work and still be
correct?  Could we reduce the size of a <code>struct context</code>?
Provide concrete examples if yes, or argue for why not.

<p>
Surround the call to <code>swtch()</code> in <code>scheduler()</code> with calls
to <code>cprintf()</code> like this:
<pre>
  cprintf("a");
  swtch(&cpu->scheduler, &proc->context);
  cprintf("b");
</pre>
<p>
Similarly,
surround the call to <code>swtch()</code> in <code>sched()</code> with calls
to <code>cprintf()</code> like this:

<pre>
  cprintf("c");
  swtch(&proc->context, cpu->scheduler);
  cprintf("d");
</pre>
<p>
Rebuild your kernel and boot it on QEMU.
With a few exceptions
you should see a regular four-character pattern repeated over and over.

<p>
<b>Turn in</b>: What is the four-character pattern?

<p>
<b>Turn in</b>: The very first characters are <code>ac</code>. Why does
this happen?


<h3>Assignment Part 3 (context switch)</h3>
When one xv6 process switches to another, two calls to swtch()
are involved: one from sched() to
scheduler(), and one from scheduler() to sched(). Bugs Bunny
suggests eliminating one of the calls: sched() could call
a variant of scheduler() directly. The new code:
<pre>
// caller must hold proc_table_lock.
void
sched(void)
{
  scheduler2();
}
// caller must hold proc_table_lock.
void
scheduler2(void)
{
  struct proc *p;
  struct proc *from = cp; // remember who we are
  int i;
  for(;;){
    for(i = 0; i < NPROC; i++){
      p = &proc[i];
      if(p->state != RUNNABLE)
        continue;
      cp = p;
      setupsegs(p);
      p->state = RUNNING;
      swtch(&from->context, &p->context);
      // a return from swtch() means some other call to
      // scheduler2() decided to run us.
      cp = from;
      setupsegs(cp);
      return;
    }
    release(&proc_table_lock);
    acquire(&proc_table_lock);
  }
}
</pre>
This new swtch()-less sched() works most of the time, but not always. What is likely to go wrong?

<h3>Assignment Part 4 (fork)</h3>
In the function <code>fork()</code>, why do we need to
store <code>pid</code>
in a temporary stack variable [2282]?
