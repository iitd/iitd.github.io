<!--
<h2>Why locks?</h2>

<p>Today's lecture will discuss how to implement
locks, some practical aspects of using them, and then look at the
implementation in xv6.

<p>Locks help us write correct code for multiprocessors.  The point of
a multiprocessor is to increase total performance by running different
tasks concurrently on different CPUs, but concurrency can cause
incorrect results if multiple tasks try to use the same variables at
the same time.  Coordination techniques prevent concurrency in
situations where the programmer has decided that serial execution is
required for correctness.

<p>
Diagram: CPUs, bus, memory.

<p>ide.c has a linked list.

<p>List and insert example:
<pre>
struct List {
  int data;
  struct List *next;
};

List *list = 0;

insert(int data) {
  List *l = new List;
  l->data = data;
  l->next = list;  // A
  list = l;        // B
}
</pre>

<p>Whoever wrote this code probably believed it was correct, in the
sense that if the list starts out correct, a call to insert() will
yield a new list that has the old elements plus the new one.
And if you call insert(), and then insert() again, the list should
have two new elements.
Most programmers write code that's only correct under <b>serial</b>
execution - in this case, insert() is only correct if there is only
one insert() executing at a time.

<p>What could go wrong with concurrent calls to insert(), as might
happen on a multiprocessor?
Suppose two different processors both call <code>insert()</code>
at the same time.
If the two processors execute A and B interleaved, then we end up with an
incorrect list.  To see that this is the case, draw out the list after
the sequence A1 (statement A executed by processor 1), A2 (statement A
executed by processor 2), B2, and B1.

<p>This kind of error is called a race (the name probably originates
in circuit design). The problem with
races is that they are difficult to reproduce.  For example, if you
put print statements in to debug the incorrect behavior, you might
change the timing and the race might not happen anymore.

<p>
What's required for insert() to be correct if executed on multiple
CPUs?  The overall property we want is that both new elements end up
appearing in the list.  One way to achieve that is to somehow ensure
that only one processor at a time is allowed to be executing
inside <code>insert()</code>; let one of the simultaneous calls
proceed, and force the other one to wait until the first has finished.
Then two simultaneous executions will have the same result as two
serial executions. Assuming <code>insert()</code> was correct when
executed serially, it will then be correct on a multiprocessor too.

<p>This happens whenever there are two independent computations
on <em>shared state</em>. e.g., you edit <code>foo.c</code> using
<code>vi</code> and compile it using <code>gcc</code>. As a matter
of habit we save the source file and wait for the confirmation
message before starting
the compile job. If we did not wait for the save to finish and
started compile simultaneously, what could happen?

<p>Concurrency in real world: one computer, many jobs; one road,
many cars; one classroom, many classes. Different solutions for
each.

<p>Another example: lost update.

<p>Increment number of hits on a website in each thread.
<code>hits</code> is a shared variable.
<pre>
hits++;
</pre>
This C statement may get compiled to multiple assemble statements:
<pre>
ld  register, [hits]
add register, register, 1
st  register, [hits]
</pre>
If two threads simultaneously execute this code, what are the possible
values of <code>hits</code>?

<p>More race condition fun:
<pre>
Thread a:
i = 0;
while (i < 10)
    i = i + 1;
print "A won!";
</pre>
<pre>
Thread b:
i = 0;
while (i > -10)
    i = i - 1;
print "B won!";
</pre>
Who wins? Guaranteed someone wins?

<p>Possible solutions:
<ul>
	<li>Do nothing: In some cases, this may be acceptable. For example,
	 a website may not care if some updates to <code>hits</code> are lost,
	 because this event is likely to be rare.
	 But the same cannot be said for other examples. Even rare races can
	 be menacing.</li>
	 <li>Don't share, but duplicate state: Sometimes possible. For example,
	 each thread could maintain a private <code>hits[i]</code> counter
	 which can be summed up at the end of the day</li>
	 <li>General solution? Prevent <em>bad</em> interleavings</li>
</ul>
-->
<h2>The lock abstraction</h2>

<p>We'd like a general tool to help programmers force serialization.
There are a number of things we'd like to be able to express for
lists:

<ol>

<li>It's not enough to serialize just calls to insert(); if there's
also delete(), we want to prevent a delete() from running at the same
time as an insert().

<li>Serializing <i>all</i> calls to insert() is too much: it's
enough to serialize just calls that refer to the same list.

<li>We don't need to serialize all of insert(), just lines A and B.

</ol>

We're looking for an abstraction that gives the
programmer this kind of control. The reason to allow concurrency
when possible (items 2 and 3) is to increase performance.

<p>
While there are many coordination abstractions, locking is among the
most common.  A lock is an object with two operations:
acquire(L) and release(L). The lock has state: it is either locked
or not locked. A call to acquire(L) waits until L is not locked,
then changes its state to locked and returns. A call to release(L)
marks L as not locked.
So when you have a data structure on which
operations should proceed one at a time (i.e. not be interleaved),
associate a lock object L with the data structure and bracket the
operations with acquire(L) and release(L).

<pre>
Lock list_lock;

insert(int data){
  List *l = new List;
  l->data = data;

  acquire(&list_lock);

  l->next = list ; // A
  list = l;        // B

  release(&list_lock);
}
</pre>

How can we implement acquire() and release()?
Here is a version that <b>DOES NOT WORK</b>:

<pre> 
struct Lock {
  int locked;
}

void broken_acquire(Lock *lock) {
  while(1){
    if(lock->locked == 0){ // C
      lock->locked = 1;    // D
      break;
    }
  }
}

void release (Lock *lock) {
  lock->locked = 0;
}
</pre>

What's the problem? Two acquire()s on the same lock on different CPUs
might both execute line C, and then both execute D.  Then both will
think they have acquired the lock.  This is the same kind of race we
were trying to eliminate in insert().  But we have made a little
progress: now we only need a way to prevent interleaving in one place
(acquire()), not for many arbitrary complex sequences of code (e.g. A
and B in insert()).

<h2>Atomic instructions</h2>

We're in luck: most CPUs provide "atomic instructions" that are
equivalent to the combination of lines C and D
and prevent interleaving from other CPUs.

<p>For example, the x86 <tt>xchg %eax, addr</tt> instruction
does the following:
<ol>
<li>freeze other CPUs' memory activity for address addr
<li>temp := *addr
<li>*addr := %eax
<li>%eax = temp
<li>un-freeze other memory activity
</ol>

<p>The CPUs and memory system cooperate to ensure
that no other operations on this memory location occur
between when <tt>xchg</tt> reads and when it writes.

<p>
We can use <tt>xchg</tt> to make a correct acquire() and release()
(you can find the actual syntax in the xv6 source):

<pre>
int xchg(addr, value){
  %eax = value
  xchg %eax, (addr)
}

void acquire(Lock *lock){
  while(1){
    if(xchg(&lock->locked, 1) == 0)
      break;
  }
}

void release(Lock *lock){
  lock->locked = 0;
}
</pre>

<p>Why does this work?  If two CPUs execute <tt>xchg</tt> at the same
time, the hardware ensures that one <tt>xchg</tt> does both its steps before the
other one starts. So we can say "the first <tt>xchg</tt>" and "the second <tt>xchg</tt>".
The first <tt>xchg</tt> will read a 0 and set lock->locked to 1 and the
acquire() will return.  The second <tt>xchg</tt> will then see lock->locked as
1, and the acquire will loop.

<p>This style of lock is called a spin-lock, since acquire()
stays in a loop while waiting for the lock.

<p>insert() with these locks is only correct if each CPU carries
out memory reads and writes in program order.
For example, if the CPU were to
execute insert() out of order so that it did the read at A before the
acquire(), then insert() would be incorrect even with locks.
Many modern processors execute memory operations out of order to increase
performance!  So we
may have to use special instructions to tell the CPU not to re-order
memory operations past acquire()s and release()s.
The compiler may also generate instructions in orders
that don't correspond to the order of the source code lines,
so we have to worry about that too.

<p>Our <tt>xchg</tt>-based acquire() is inefficient when
it has to wait because
the continuous <tt>xchg</tt> instructions interfere with
useful use of the memory system.
In a later lecture we will see how to do better.

<h2>Spinning vs blocking</h2>

<p>Spin-locks are good when protecting short operations: increment a
counter, search in i-node cache, allocate a free buffer. In these
cases acquire() won't waste much CPU time spinning even if another
CPU holds the lock.

<p>Spin locks are not so great for code that has to wait for events
that might take a long time. For example, it would not be good for the
disk reading code to get a spin-lock on the disk hardware, start a
read, wait for the disk to finish reading the data, and then release the
lock.  The disk often takes 10s of milliseconds (millions of instructions)
to complete an operation.
Spinning wastes the CPU; if another process is waiting to
execute, it would be better to run that process until the disk
signals it is finished by causing an interrupt.

<p>xv6 has sleep() and wakeup() primitives that are better for
processes that need to wait for I/O.

<h2>Lock granularity</h2>

This lock abstraction gives the programmer lots of flexibility, since
the programmer can associate lock objects with code or data in
whatever way seems best.  For example, suppose you are implementing a
file system that will be used in a multi-processor
kernel like xv6.  The file system can have a single lock,
or a lock per distinct file system (disk), or a lock per directory.
How to decide?

<p>
There are two big questions to think about, correctness and
performance. Worry about correctness first.  The easiest way to get
correct locking is to have just a single lock, that every function
grabs at the start and releases at the end.  A "big" lock requires
relatively little thought to achieve correctness, since it prevents
any concurrency within your software.  Even complicated operations,
like rename() between directories, don't require special treatment.

<p>
The potential performance problem with a big lock is that only one
CPU at a time can execute anywhere in your code. If your code is
called a lot, this may reduce the performance of an expensive
multiprocessor to that of a single CPU.
Perhaps locking at smaller granularity would get
higher performance through more concurrency. How to best reduce lock
granularity is a bit of an art. You might inspect the file system code
and notice that most operations use just one file or directory,
leading you to have one lock per inode.  But then cross-directory
operations, like path-name lookup and rename(), will need special
attention to get the locking right.

<h2>Locks and modularity</h2>

<p>When designing a system we desire clean abstractions and good
  modularity. We'd like a caller not to have to know how a callee
  implements a particular function.  We'd like to hide locking
  behavior in this way -- for example, it would be nice if 
  the lock on each file-system inode was the private business of 
  methods on inodes.

<p>It turns out it's hard to use locks in a modular way. Two
problems come up that require non-modular global knowledge:
multi-module invariants and deadlock.

<p>First, multi-module invariants. You could imagine the code
implementing directories exporting various operations like
<code>dir_lookup(d, name)</code>,
<code>dir_add(d, name, inumber)</code>, and
<code>dir_del(d, name)</code>.
These directory operations would each acquire the lock on <code>d</code>,
do their work, and release the lock.
Then higher-level code could implement operations like 
moving a file from one directory to another (one case of
the UNIX <code>rename()</code> system call):

<pre>
move(olddir, oldname, newdir, newname){
  inumber = dir_lookup(olddir, oldname)
  dir_del(olddir, oldname)
  dir_add(newdir, newname, inumber)
}
</pre>

This code is pleasingly simple, but has a number of problems. One of
them is that there's a period of time when the file is visible in
neither directory.  Fixing that, sadly, seems to require that the
directory locks <i>not</i> be hidden inside the <code>dir_</code>
operations, thus:

<pre>
move(olddir, oldname, newdir, newname){
  acquire(olddir.lock)
  acquire(newdir.lock)
  inumber = dir_lookup(olddir, oldname)
  dir_del(olddir, oldname)
  dir_add(newdir, newname, inumber)
  release(newdir.lock)
  release(olddir.lock)
}
</pre>

<p>
The above code is ugly in that it exposes the implementation of
directories to <code>move()</code>, but (if all you have is locks)
you have to do it this way.

<p>The second big problem is deadlock. Notice that <code>move()</code>
holds two locks. What would happen if one process called
<code>move(dirA, ..., dir B, ...)</code> while another process called
<code>move(dirB, ..., dir A, ...)</code>?

<p>In an operating system the usual solution is to avoid deadlocks by
establishing an order on all locks and making sure that every thread
acquires its locks in that order.  For the file system the rule might
be to lock the directory with the lowest inode first.
Picking and obeying the order on <i>all</i> locks requires that modules
make public their locking behavior, and requires them to know about
other module's locking. This can be painful and error-prone.

<p>Fine-grained locks usually make both of these problems worse.

<h2>A slightly larger example</h2>

Here's some code that maintains a pool of counters, allows callers to
allocate a counter, to increment and read a counter, and to free the
counter when done. How should we add locks?

<pre>
#define N 100
struct counter {
  int count;
  int allocated;
};
struct counter counters[N];

struct counter *
alloc(){
  struct counter *c;
  
  for(c = counters; c < &counters[N]; c++){
    if(c->allocated == 0){
      c->allocated = 1;
      c->count = 0;
      return c;
    }
  }
  panic("out of counters");
}

void
inc(struct counter *c){
  c->count = c->count + 1;
}

int
get(struct counter *c){
  return c->count;
}

void
dealloc(struct counter *c)
{
  c->allocated = 0;
}

</pre>

<p>What might go wrong with this code on a multiprocessor? Is the code
necessarily broken on a multiprocessor?

<p>We could have a single "big" lock, acquire and release it at the
start/end of each function. Would that be correct? Why might it have,
or not have, good performance?

<p>We could have finer-grained locks: one per counter. Would that
likely lead to higher performance?

<p>With per-counter locks, how would we lock in alloc()?

<p>Does inc() need to acquire a lock? Are there circumstances where
get() might not need to lock?

<p>Does get() need to lock?

<p>Does dealloc() need to lock?

<h2>Some terms</h2>

<p>Locks are a way to implement "mutual exclusion", which is the
property that only one CPU at a time can be executing a certain piece
of code.  This is also called "isolation atomicity".

<p>The code between an acquire() and a release() is sometimes called a
"critical section."

<p>The more general idea of ensuring one thread waits for another when
neccessary for correctness is called "coordination."  People have
invented a huge number of coordination primitives; locks are just one
example, which we use because they are simple. We'll see some more
coordination primitives in a few lectures.

<h2>Locking in xv6</h2>

<p>xv6 runs on a multiprocessor and allows multiple CPUs to 
execute concurrently inside the kernel. These usually correspond to system calls
made by processes running on different CPUs.  There might also be
interrupt handlers running at the same time as other kernel code. An
interrupt can occur on any of the CPUs; both user-level processes and
processes inside the kernel can be interrupted.  xv6 uses spin-locks
to coordinate how these concurrent activities share data structures.

<p>How do xv6 locks work? Let's look at acquire() in spinlock.c. [1350]
<ul>
<li>what does pushcli() do?
<li>why does pushcli() count nested calls?
<li>so why disable interrupts on the current processor?
<li>holding() is true if the current CPU already holds the lock.
why is it bad for a CPU to re-acquire a lock it already has?
</ul>

<p>And release():
<ul>
<li>1419: why not just lock->locked = 0?
</ul>

<p>Let's look at the IDE disk driver as an example of xv6's use of
locks. Sheet 34.  The file system kernel code calls ide_rw() to read or write a
block of data from/to the disk.  ide_rw() should return when the read
or write has completed.  There may be multiple calls to ide_rw()
outstanding because multiple processes may be reading files at the
same time. The disk can only perform one operation at a time, so the
IDE driver keeps a queue of requests that are waiting their turn.

<p>The IDE driver has just one lock (ide_lock). This one lock helps
enforce multiple invariants required for correct operation:

<ul>
<li> Only one thread should be inserting or deleting from ide_queue
at a time.
<li> Only one thread should be commanding the IDE hardware (via
inb/outb instructions) at a time.
<li> The disk hardware can only execute one read or write at a time.
</ul>

<p>The software (and hardware) for these activities was all designed for
one-at-a-time use, which is why it needs locking.

<p>What happens if two processes call ide_rw() at the same time
from different CPUs? [3454]

<p>ide_intr() deletes a request from ide_queue (line 3422).
What happens if an IDE
interrupt occurs when a process is adding a block to the queue?

<p>Why does idestart() want the caller to hold the
lock? Why doesn't it just acquire the lock itself?

<p>recursive locks are a bad idea<br>
ideintr should certainly not use that instead of disabling interrupts!

<p>lock ordering<br>
iderw: sleep acquires plock<br>
never acquire plock and then ide_lock
<!--
<h2>Locking in JOS</h2>

<p>JOS is meant to run on single-CPU machines. It doesn't have to
worry about concurrent operations from other CPUs, but it does have to
worry about interrupts. JOS takes a simple approach: it turns
interrupts off for the entire time it is executing in the kernel. For
the most part this means JOS kernel code doesn't have to do anything
special in situations where xv6 would use locks.

<p>JOS runs environments in user-mode with interrupts enabled, so at
any point a timer interrupt may take the CPU away from an environment
and switch to a different environment. This interleaves the two
environments' instructions a bit like running them on two CPUs.  The
library operating system has some data structures in memory that's
shared among multiple environments (e.g. pipes), so it needs a way to
coordinate access to that data.  In JOS we will use special-case
solutions, as you will find out in lab 6.  For example, to implement
pipes we will assume there is one reader and one writer.  The reader
and writer never update each others' variables; they only read each
others' variables.  Carefully programming using this rule we can avoid
races.
