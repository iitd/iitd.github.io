<h1>CSL373 Lab 1: Initializing PC Hardware</h1>
<!--<p>
<b>Handed out Thursday, January 10, 2013<br />
	Due Monday, February 4, 2013</b>-->
<p>
<i>PIOS lab materials have been taken from Bryan Ford's CS422 at Yale University.</i>
</p>

<p><b>This lab is to be done individually.</b></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In this lab,
you will start building a kernel called PIOS,
for <i>Parallel Instructional Operating System</i>.
PIOS uses some of the same source code as xv6,
and is also derived from JOS,
the <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2009/overview.html"
	>6.828 kernel</a>,
but is structured quite differently from either xv6 or JOS.
Like xv6, PIOS supports multiprocessor and multicore systems.
While xv6 closely follows a classic Unix design
and JOS follows an <a href="../ref/engler95exokernel.pdf">exokernel</a> philosophy,
PIOS combines concepts from classic microkernels
like <a href="../bib/liedtke95micro.pdf">L4</a>
with new ideas inspired by the growing need
to support large-scale parallelism on modern computers.
You will learn more about the design of PIOS gradually
as you work through this course.

<p>
This first lab focuses on getting a skeleton PIOS kernel up and running
to a point where it provides
a basic, functional kernel development environment.
The lab contains four parts:
<ol>
<li>	Making the kernel produce useful output:
	i.e., printing to the console.
	Most of this somewhat boring I/O code is done for you;
	you will just have to fill in a couple short missing pieces.

<li>	Setting up the processor so that any traps the kernel causes,
	such as an illegal instruction or memory accesses
	(usually indicating a bug in the kernel)
	will be caught by the kernel and yield a useful "panic" message
	instead of just causing the machine to reboot mysteriously.

<li>	Implement <i>protected control transfer</i>,
	enabling the kernel to run application code in a less privileged mode
	and safely recover control when the application makes a system call
	or a trap occurs during its execution.

<li>	Determining the amount of physical memory available
	and implementing a dynamic memory allocator for it,
	so that code in future labs will be able to allocate and free memory.
</ol>

<h3>Software Setup</h3>
The files you will need for this and subsequent lab assignments in this course
are distributed using the <a href=http://git-scm.org>Git</a> version control system.
To learn more about Git, take
a look at the Git
<a href=http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html>tutorial</a>
and
<a href=http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html>user's manual</a>.
Or if you are already familiar with other version control systems, you may find this
<a href=http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/>CS-oriented overview of Git</a> useful.

The Git repository is in <code>/misc/research/teaching/sbansal/csl373/pios.git</code>
on the GCL machines. To install the files in your own account, you need to
clone the sourse repository, like this:
<pre>
$ git clone /misc/research/teaching/sbansal/csl373/pios.git lab
Initialized empty Git repository in .../lab/.git/
$ cd lab
$ 
</pre>

If you want to clone the repository remotely onto a non-GCL machine, you can do so
over ssh by using
<code>ssh://username@palasi.cse.iitd.ernet.in/misc/research/teaching/sbansal/csl373/pios.git</code>
as the
source pathname.

Git allows you to keep track of the changes you make to the code. For example, if you are finished with one of the exercises, and want to checkpoint your progress, you can commit your changes by running:

<pre>
$ git commit -am 'my solution for lab1 exercise9'
Created commit 60d2135: my solution for lab1 exercise9
 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
$ 
</pre>

You can keep track of your changes by using the <code>git diff</code> command. Running
<code>git diff</code> will display the changes to your code since your last commit,
and <code>git diff origin/lab1</code> will display the changes relative to the
initial code supplied for this lab. Here, origin/lab1 is the name of the git branch
with the initial code you downloaded from our server for this assignment.

The same compilers and simulators you are already using to explore xv6 will
work for the labs. If you are working on a non-GCL machine, the
<a href=../tools.html>tools</a> page has directions on how to set up qemu and gcc
for use with this course.

Once you have the Git repository cloned in your account, you can build the
PIOS skeleton by typing <code>make</code>, and you can run or debug it
under QEMU by typing
<code>make qemu</code> or <code>make qemu-gdb</code>, respectively, just as with
xv6. The skeleton won't get very far, of course: it will quickly panic in
one of the functions you will need to implement.

<h3>Inline Assembly</h3>

<p>
In this lab you may find GCC's inline assembly language feature useful,
although it is also possible to complete the lab without using it.
At the very least, you will need to be able to understand
the fragments of inline assembly language ("asm" statements)
that already exist in the source code we gave you.
You can find several sources of information
on GCC inline assembly language
on the <a href="../reference.html">reference</a> page.
</p>

<h3>Hand-In Procedure</h3>
<p>
<i>The exact handin procedure is to be determined;
we will update this section closer to the lab's due date.</i>

<p>
You do not need to turn in answers
to any of the questions in the text of the lab.
(Do answer them for yourself though!  They will help with the rest of the lab.)

<p>
We will be grading your solutions with a grading program.
You can run <kbd>make grade</kbd>
to test your solutions with the grading program.

<h2>Part 1: Printing to the Console</h2>

<p>
We will now start to examine the minimal PIOS kernel in a bit more detail.
PIOS uses essentially the same boot loader code as xv6,
which you examined in the lecture homeworks, so we will skip that part.
Once the boot loader loads the kernel's ELF image,
it jumps to the kernel entrypoint,
namely the <code>start</code> label in <tt>kern/entry.S</tt>.
This assembly language entrypoint code
just performs basic initialization
and then calls the C function <code>init()</code> in <tt>kern/init.c</tt>.
After zeroing out the kernel's uninitialized data area
(which is expected by C program loading conventions
but the boot loader didn't bother to do when it was loading the kernel),
the first thing the kernel does is initialize the console device driver
so that your kernel can produce visible output.
</p>

<h3>Formatted Printing to the Console</h3>

<p>
Most people take functions like <tt>printf()</tt> for granted,
sometimes even thinking of them as "primitives" of the C language.
But in an OS kernel, we have to implement all I/O ourselves.
</p>

<p>
Read through <tt>kern/console.c</tt>, <tt>lib/printfmt.c</tt>,
<tt>dev/kbd.c</tt>, and <tt>dev/video.c</tt>,
and make sure you understand their relationship.
It will become clear in later labs why <tt>printfmt.c</tt>
is located in the separate <tt>lib</tt> directory.
</p>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
	We have omitted a small fragment of code -
	the code necessary to print octal numbers
	using patterns of the form "%o".
	Find and fill in this code fragment.
</p></div>

<p>
Be able to answer the following questions:
</p>

<ol>
<li> Explain the interface
between <tt>vcprintf()</tt> in <tt>kern/console.c</tt>
and <tt>vprintfmt()</tt> in <tt>lib/printfmt.c</tt>.
Specifically, how does <tt>vcprintf()</tt> tell <tt>vprintfmt()</tt>
how to display a character?

<li> Explain the following from <tt>video.c</tt>:
<pre>
1      if (crt_pos &gt;= CRT_SIZE) {
2              int i;
3              memcpy(crt_buf, crt_buf + CRT_COLS,
4			(CRT_SIZE - CRT_COLS) * sizeof(uint16_t));
5              for (i = CRT_SIZE - CRT_COLS; i &lt; CRT_SIZE; i++)
6                      crt_buf[i] = 0x0700 | ' ';
7              crt_pos -= CRT_COLS;
8      }
</pre></li>

<li> For the following questions you might wish to consult
the notes for Lecture 2.
These notes cover GCC's calling convention on the x86.

<p>
Trace the execution of the following code step-by-step:
</p>
<pre>
int x = 1, y = 3, z = 4;
cprintf("x %d, y %x, z %d\n", x, y, z);
</pre>
<ul>
<li>	In the call to <code>cprintf()</code>,
	to what does <code>fmt</code> point?
	To what does <code>ap</code> point?</li>

<li> List (in order of execution) each call to
<code>cons_putc</code>, <code>va_arg</code>, and <code>vcprintf</code>.
For <code>cons_putc</code>, list its argument as well.  For
<code>va_arg</code>, list what <code>ap</code> points to before and
after the call.  For <code>vcprintf</code> list the values of its
two arguments.</li>

</ul></li>
<li> Run the following code.
<pre>
    unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
    cprintf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &amp;i);
</pre>

What is the output?  Explain how this output is arrived at in the
step-by-step manner of the previous exercise.
<a href="http://web.cs.mun.ca/~michael/c/ascii-table.html">Here's an ASCII
  table</a> that maps bytes to characters.

<p>The output depends on that fact that the x86 is little-endian.  If
the x86 were instead big-endian what would you set <code>i</code> to in
order to yield the same output?  Would you need to change
<code>57616</code> to a different value?</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/b/big_endian.html">Here's
a description of little- and big-endian</a>
and
<a href="http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/ien/ien137.txt">a more
whimsical description</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
In the following code, what is going to be printed after
<code>'y='</code>?  (note: the answer is not a specific value.)  Why
does this happen?

<pre>
    cprintf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
</pre>
</li>

<li>
Let's say that GCC changed its calling convention so that it
pushed arguments on the stack in declaration order,
so that the last argument is pushed last.
How would you have to change <code>cprintf</code> or its
interface so that it would still be possible to pass it a variable
number of arguments?
</li>
</ol>

<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge</span>
	Enhance the console to allow text to be printed in different colors.
	The traditional way to do this is to make it interpret
	<a href="http://www.dee.ufcg.edu.br/~rrbrandt/tools/ansi.html">
	ANSI escape sequences</a>
	embedded in the text strings printed to the console,
	but you may use any mechanism you like.
	There is plenty of information on
	<a href="../reference.html">the reference page</a>
	and elsewhere on the web on programming the VGA display hardware.
	If you're feeling really adventurous,
	you could try switching the VGA hardware into a graphics mode
	and making the console draw text onto the graphical frame buffer.
</p></div>


<h3>The Stack</h3>

<p>
We will now explore in more detail
the way the C language uses the stack on the x86,
and in the process write a useful function
that computes a <i>backtrace</i> of the stack:
a list of the saved Instruction Pointer (IP) values
from the nested <tt>call</tt> instructions that
led to the current point of execution.
</p>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
	Determine where the kernel initializes its stack,
	and exactly where in memory its stack is located.
	How does the kernel reserve space for its stack?
	And at which "end" of this reserved area
	is the stack pointer initialized to point to?
</p></div>

<p>
The x86 stack pointer (<tt>esp</tt> register)
points to the lowest location on the stack that is
currently in use.
Everything <i>below</i> that location in the region reserved for the stack
is free.
Pushing a value onto the stack involves decreasing the stack
pointer and then writing the value to the place the stack pointer
points to.
Popping a value from the stack involves reading the value
the stack pointer points to and then increasing the stack pointer.
In 32-bit mode, the stack can only hold 32-bit values,
and esp is always divisible by four.
Various x86 instructions, such as <tt>call</tt>,
are "hard-wired" to use the stack pointer register.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>ebp</tt> (base pointer) register, in contrast,
is associated with the stack primarily by software convention.
On entry to a C function,
the function's <i>prologue</i> code normally
saves the previous function's base pointer by pushing it onto the stack,
and then copies the current <tt>esp</tt> value into <tt>ebp</tt>
for the duration of the function.
If all the functions in a program obey this convention,
then at any given point during the program's execution,
it is possible to trace back through the stack
by following the chain of saved <tt>ebp</tt> pointers
and determining exactly what nested sequence of function calls
caused this particular point in the program to be reached.
This capability can be particularly useful, for example,
when a particular function causes an <tt>assert</tt> failure or <tt>panic</tt>
because bad arguments were passed to it,
but you aren't sure <i>who</i> passed the bad arguments.
A stack backtrace lets you find the offending function.
</p>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>
	To become familiar with the C calling conventions on the x86,
	set a breakpoint at <code>debug_trace</code>
	in <tt>kern/debug.c</tt>,
	and examine the state of the stack at the point it gets called.
	Get GDB to give you a backtrace via the <kbd>bt</kbd> command,
	compare GDB's backtrace with the "raw" contents of the stack,
	and make sure you understand how GDB got that backtrace.
	How many 32-bit words does each nested function push on the stack,
	and what are those words?</p>
</p></div>

<p>
The above exercise should give you the information you need
to implement <tt>debug_trace()</tt>,
which collects into an array the EIPs from
up to <code>DEBUG_TRACEFRAMES</code> (10) stack frames
starting at the EBP specified in the argument.
This function will be used in multiple ways in the kernel,
helping to provide meaningful context information for debugging
when something goes seriously wrong with the system.
</p>

<p>
Note that if there are fewer than 10 frames on the stack,
<code>debug_trace</code> should set the rest of the EIPs to NULL.
By studying <tt>kern/entry.S</tt>
you'll find that there is an easy way to tell when to stop.
</p>

<p>
Besides collecting the EIPs in the array passed by the caller,
you may find it useful (at least for the moment)
to make <code>debug_trace</code> print not only the EIP from each frame
but the frame pointer itself and a few of each function's arguments.
For example:
</p>

<pre>
Stack backtrace:
  ebp f0109e58  eip f0100a62  args 00000001 f0109e80 f0109e98 f0100ed2 00000031
  ebp f0109ed8  eip f01000d6  args 00000000 00000000 f0100058 f0109f28 00000061
  ...
</pre>

<p>
Within each line of this example,
the <tt>ebp</tt> value indicates the base pointer into the stack
used by that function:
i.e., the position of the stack pointer just after the function was entered
and the function prologue code set up the base pointer.
The listed <tt>eip</tt> value
is the function's return instruction pointer,
where control will return when the function returns.
The return instruction pointer typically points to the instruction
after the <tt>call</tt> instruction (why?).
Finally, the five hex values listed after <tt>args</tt>
are the first five arguments to the function in question,
which would have been pushed on the stack just before the function was called.
If the function was called with fewer than five arguments, of course,
then not all five of these values will be useful.
(Why can't the backtrace code detect how many arguments there actually are?
How could this limitation be fixed?)
</p>

<p>
Here are a few specific points you read about in K&amp;R Chapter 5 that are
worth remembering for the following exercise and for future labs.
</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>int *p = (int*)100</code>, then 
    <code>(int)p + 1</code> and <code>(int)(p + 1)</code>
    are different numbers: the first is <code>101</code> but
    the second is <code>104</code>.
    When adding an integer to a pointer, as in the second case,
    the integer is implicitly multiplied by the size of the object
    the pointer points to.</li>
<li><code>p[i]</code> is defined to be the same as <code>*(p+i)</code>,
referring to the i'th object in the memory pointed to by p.
The above rule for addition helps this definition work
when the objects are larger than one byte.</li>
<li> <code>&amp;p[i]</code> is the same as <code>(p+i)</code>, yielding
the address of the i'th object in the memory pointed to by p.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Although most C programs never need to cast between pointers and integers,
operating systems frequently do.
Whenever you see an addition involving a memory address,
ask yourself whether it is an integer addition or pointer addition
and make sure the value being added is appropriately multiplied
or not.
</p>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 4.</span>
	Implement the <code>debug_trace</code> function as specified above.
	When you think you have it working right,
	run <kbd>make grade</kbd> to see if the checking code agrees,
	and fix it if it doesn't.
</p></div>


<h2>Part 2: Trap Handling</h2>

<p>
One of the most important functions of any OS kernel
is to handle processor traps that occur during execution
of either its own code or application code.
For this part of the lab,
the first thing you should do
is thoroughly familiarize yourself with
the x86 interrupt and exception mechanism.
</p>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 5.</span>
	Read Chapter 5, Interrupt and Exception Handling,
	in the
	<a href="../ref/ia32-3.pdf">IA-32 System Programming Guide</a>,
	if you haven't already.
</p></div>

<p>
There are many types and classifications of traps,
and the terminology used to describe them
is unfortunately have no fully standard meanings,
even within a single processor architecture such as the x86.
We will distinguish between two main classes of traps:
<i>exceptions</i> such as illegal instruction or divide by zero,
whose cause is directly related to the code the processor is running;
and <i>interrupts</i>,
which are generated asynchronously by external I/O devices or other CPUs
and whose cause may have nothing to do with the code
that happens to be running at the time the interrupt arrives.
We will generally use the term <i>trap</i> as a generic term
referring to both exceptions and interrupts,
but note that the Intel manuals uses the term differently,
to refer to a specific subcategory of exceptions.
When you see these terms outside of this lab,
the meanings may differ further.

<p>
This part of the lab focuses on
handling traps that occur while the processor is running
in the x86 processor's most privileged mode, ring 0,
which by convention we call "kernel mode".
The next part of the lab will
use traps to implement <i>protected control transfer</i>,
allowing the kernel to enter user mode (ring 3)
and later recover control safely from traps that occur in user mode.

<h3>Handling Kernel Traps</h3>

Like any nontrivial software, most OS kernels have bugs -
especially during development, but typically even after deployment.
And kernels typically have no "guard-rails" to keep their bugs contained:
an application bug typically only causes that application to crash
because the kernel is there to protect applications from each other,
but a kernel bug typically causes the whole machine to crash
because there is no other software "under" the kernel
protecting the kernel from itself.
(The obvious exception is when running the kernel
in a virtual machine of some kind, such as QEMU,
where QEMU prevents guest kernel bugs from escaping the virtual machine.)

<p>
When a kernel bug does manifest itself,
there is no guarantee anything can be done -
the bug could have caused the system to go into practically any state,
from which no recovery of any kind might be possible.
But often the bug causes the processor to take a trap at some point,
and it may be possible to recover from the bug
at least enough to collect and output
some potentially useful information about what happened.
But the processor does not know how to generate a "kernel bug report":
it only knows how to take a trap;
the kernel itself must <i>handle</i> the trap and produce the bug report.
We will now create a trap handler for PIOS
to help catch and report on such bugs.
(You will later extend this same trap handling mechanism
to handle protected control transfer, virtual memory faults,
and external device interrupts).

<p>
Every widespread operating system seems to develop
an entire subculture surrounding its kernel trap handling mechanism:
this is what
a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death"
	>blue screen of death</a>" (Windows),
a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sad_Mac"
	>Sad Mac</a>", or
a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Meditation"
	>guru meditation</a>" (Amiga) is.
Now it's time to implement your own screen of death.

<h3>The Interrupt Descriptor Table</h3>

<p>
The x86 processor uses a table known as the
<i>interrupt descriptor table</i> (IDT)
to determine how to transfer control when a trap occurs.
The x86 allows up to 256 different
interrupt or exception entry points into the kernel,
each with a different <i>interrupt vector</i>.
A vector is a number between 0 and 256.
An interrupt's vector is determined by the
source of the interrupt: different devices, error
conditions, and application requests to the kernel
generate interrupts with different vectors.
The CPU uses the vector as an index
into the processor's IDT,
which the kernel sets up in kernel-private memory of the kernel's choosing,
much like the GDT.
From the appropriate entry in this table
the processor loads:

<ul>
<li>	the value to load into
	the instruction pointer (<tt>EIP</tt>) register,
	pointing to the kernel code designated
	to handle that type of exception.</li>
<li>	the value to load into
	the code segment (<tt>CS</tt>) register,
	which includes in bits 0-1 the privilege level
	at which the exception handler is to run.
	In PIOS, all exceptions are handled in kernel mode,
	privilege level 0.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Entering and Returning from Trap Handlers</h3>

<p>
When an x86 processor takes a trap while in kernel mode,
it first pushes a <i>trap frame</i> onto the kernel stack,
to save the old values of certain registers
before the trap handling mechanism modifies them.
The processor then
looks up the CS and EIP of the trap handler in the IDT,
and transfers control to that instruction address.
The following diagram illustrates the format
of the basic kernel trap frame,
defining the state of the kernel stack on entry to the trap handler:
</p>
<pre>
                     +--------------------+ &lt;---- old ESP
                     |     old EFLAGS     |     " - 4
                     | 0x00000 | old CS   |     " - 8
                     |      old EIP       |     " - 12
                     +--------------------+ &lt;---- ESP
</pre>

<p>
For certain types of x86 exceptions,
in addition to the basic three 32-bit words above,
the processor pushes onto the stack another word
containing an <i>error code</i>.
The page fault exception, number 14,
is an important example.
See the x86 manuals to determine for which exception numbers
the processor pushes an error code,
and what the error code means in that case.
When the processor pushes an error code,
the stack would look as follows at the beginning of the trap handler:
</p>

	<pre>
                     +--------------------+ &lt;---- old ESP
                     |     old EFLAGS     |     " - 4
                     | 0x00000 | old CS   |     " - 8
                     |      old EIP       |     " - 12
                     |     error code     |     " - 16
                     +--------------------+ &lt;---- ESP
	</pre>

<p>
The x86 processor provides a special instruction, <samp>iret</samp>,
to return from trap handlers.
It expects the kernel's stack to look like the <i>first</i> figure above,
with ESP pointing to the old EIP.
When the processor executes an <samp>iret</samp> instruction,
pops the saved values of EIP, CS, and EFLAGS off the stack
and back into the corresponding registers,
and resumes instruction execution at the popped EIP.

<p>
Note that when returning from a trap,
the processor doesn't actually know or care
whether the "old" values it is popping off the stack
are really the exact same values
that it originally pushed onto the stack on entry to the trap handler.
Think about what would happen - for better or worse -
if the kernel trap handler
changes these values during its execution.

<h3>Nested Traps</h3>

<p>
Because the processor handles a trap
by pushing the old EIP (and some other state) on the stack
and then transferring control to a designated instruction address,
trap handling in the x86 works very analogously to procedure calls,
and like ordinary procedure calls, traps can be nested.
That is, if the processor is already in the process of handling one trap,
and the trap handler itself causes an exception
or is interrupted by an external device,
then the processor merely pushes another trap frame onto the stack
and transfers control to the appropriate trap handler.
The processor itself doesn't maintain any state
reflecting the fact that the second trap handler is nested inside the first:
as far as the processor is concerned it is simply pushing
a standard frame onto the stack and transferring control in a standard way
whenever a trap occurs.
All of the state of both interrupted activities remains on the stack,
and can later be "unwound" by returning from the two trap handlers
in reverse order, again analogously to ordinary procedure returns.

<p>
Nested trap handling is often extremely important in kernel development,
both for its utility and its danger:
it is often highly useful to allow one trap handler
to be interrupted by another,
but <i>unintentional</i> nesting can cause extremely subtle and difficult bugs.
There is also one important caveat
to the processor's nested trap handling capability.
If the processor takes a trap while already in kernel mode,
and <i>cannot push its old state onto the kernel stack</i> for any reason
such as lack of stack space,
then there is nothing the processor can do to recover,
so it simply resets itself.
Needless to say, the kernel should be designed so that this can't happen.
</p>

<h3>Setting Up the IDT</h3>

<p>
You should now have the basic information you need
in order to set up the IDT and handle exceptions in PIOS.
For now, you will set up the IDT to handle 
interrupt vectors 0-31 (the processor exceptions).
</p>

<p>
The header files <tt>inc/trap.h</tt> and <tt>kern/trap.h</tt>
contain important definitions
that you will need to become familiar with.
The file <tt>kern/trap.h</tt> contains definitions
that are strictly private to the kernel,
while <tt>inc/trap.h</tt>
contains definitions that may also be useful
to user-level programs and libraries.
The skeleton source code for PIOS's trap handling mechanism
is in <tt>kern/trap.c</tt> (the C part)
and <tt>kern/trapasm.S</tt> (the assembly language part).
</p>

<p>
Note:
Some of the exceptions in the range 0-31 are defined by Intel to be
reserved.
Since they will never be generated by the processor,
it doesn't really matter how you handle them.
Do whatever you think is cleanest.
</p>

<p>
The overall flow of control that you should achieve is depicted below: 
</p>

<pre>
      IDT                   trapasm.S         trap.c
   
+----------------+                        
|   &amp;handler1    |---------> handler1:          trap (struct Trapframe *tf)
|                |             // do stuff      {
|                |             call trap          // handle the exception/interrupt
|                |             // undo stuff    }
+----------------+
|   &amp;handler2    |--------> handler2:
|                |            // do stuff
|                |            call trap
|                |            // undo stuff
+----------------+
       .
       .
       .
+----------------+
|   &amp;handlerX    |--------> handlerX:
|                |             // do stuff
|                |             call trap
|                |             // undo stuff
+----------------+
</pre>

<p>
Each exception should have
its own handler in <tt>trapasm.S</tt>
and <code>trap_idt_init()</code> should initialize the IDT with the addresses
of these handlers.
Each of the handlers should build a <code>struct trapframe</code>
(see <tt>inc/trap.h</tt>) on the stack and call 
<code>trap()</code> (in <tt>trap.c</tt>)
with a pointer to that trapframe.
</p>

<p>
<code>trap()</code> handles the
exception/interrupt or dispatches to a specific
handler function.
If and when <code>trap()</code> returns,
the code in <tt>trapasm.S</tt>
restores the old CPU state saved in the Trapframe
and then uses the <code>iret</code> instruction
to return from the exception.
</p>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 6.</span>
	Edit <tt>trapasm.S</tt> and <tt>trap.c</tt> and

	<code>TRAPHANDLER</code> and <code>TRAPHANDLER_NOEC</code> in
	<tt>trapasm.S</tt> should help you, as well as the T_*

	for each trap defined in <tt>inc/trap.h</tt>, and

</p></div>

<h3>Returning from Traps</h3>

<p>
You will now need to implement the complement of the trap entry code:
namely the code to return from a trap.

<p>
In many kernels, including xv6,
the high-level trap handling code written in C returns from a trap
simply by returning from the C procedure
corresponding to PIOS's <tt>trap()</tt>.
PIOS follows a different convention, however.
You might notice the <tt>gcc_noreturn</tt> macro
(see <tt>inc/gcc.h</tt>)
in the definition of the <tt>trap()</tt> function,
which declares that this function "never returns",
at least as far as GCC is concerned.
In PIOS, kernel code returns from a trap
by performing <i>another call</i>,
to the function <tt>trap_return()</tt>,
which is also declared in <tt>trap.h</tt> never to return.
See <tt>trap_check_recover()</tt> for an example of how it is used.
Those familiar with programming language implementation
will recognize this as <i>tail-call</i> style programming.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 7.</span>

	Implement the <tt>trap_return()</tt> function in <tt>trapasm.S</tt>.
	(Alternatively, you may implement it in <tt>kern/trap.c</tt>
	using inline assembly language if you prefer.)

	The <tt>trap_return()</tt> function
	takes a pointer to a <tt>trapframe</tt> structure as an argument,
	and first "unwinds" the stack
	to the point where that <tt>trapframe</tt> was pushed,
	discarding any information that has been pushed onto the stack
	since that point.
	The code then restores all the saved register state
	from the <tt>trapframe</tt>
	and returns from the trap via the <samp>iret</samp> instruction.

	We have provided a function <tt>trap_check()</tt>

<h2>Part 3: Privilege Levels and Protected Control Transfer</h2>

So far in PIOS we have used only <i>kernel mode</i> or <i>ring 0</i>,
the processor's most privileged level.
To protect the kernel from unruly applications,
and in turn applications from each other,
the kernel must be able to protect both its own code and data,
and various sensitive parts of the processor's state,
from accidental or malicious modification by application code.
An x86-based kernel protects its state in memory from applications
by using the processor's virtual memory facilities,
which we will use later in lab 3.

<p>
For now, we will focus on the other requirement:
protecting sensitive processor state from application code.
If any application could run a <tt>lidt</tt> instruction to change the IDT,
for example,
then the application could wrest control of trap handling
away from the kernel
and redirect all traps to handlers of the application's choosing.
The x86 processor provides multiple <i>privilege levels</i> or <i>rings</i>
to enable operating systems to protect sensitive processor state.
To protect the location of the sensitive IDT, for example,
the x86 architecture restricts the use of the <tt>lidt</tt> instruction
to code running in ring 0;
the kernel can thus prevent applications
from executing <tt>lidt</tt> and other sensitive instructions
by running application code at a lower privilege level.
To do so, however,
the kernel must still have a protected way
to get <i>into</i> and back <i>out of</i> lower privilege levels.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 8.</span>
	Read Chapter 4, Protection,
	in the
	<a href="../ref/ia32-3.pdf">IA-32 System Programming Guide</a>,
	if you haven't already.
</p></div>

<h3>Basics of Protected Control Transfer</h3>

<p>
In most processor architectures including the x86,
the trap handling mechanism
doubles as a <i>protected control transfer</i> mechanism,
enabling the kernel to transfer control safely
to and from code running at lower privilege levels.
When the processor is running in user mode (ring 3 on the x86)
and takes a trap or makes an explicit system call,
the processor must transfer control to the kernel,
but it is crucial for protection purposes that
the user mode code currently running
<i>does not get to choose arbitrarily where the kernel is entered or how</i>.
Instead,
the processor ensures that the kernel can be entered
only under carefully controlled conditions.
On the x86, two mechanisms work together to provide this protection:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>	<b>The Interrupt Descriptor Table.</b>
	As you have already seen in the previous part,
	through the IDT
	the processor ensures that interrupts and exceptions
	can only cause the kernel to be entered
	at a few specific, well-defined entry-points
	<i>determined by the kernel itself</i>,
	and not by the code running
	when the interrupt or exception is taken.
	This mechanism effectively protects
	the instruction pointer (EIP) address used to handle traps.

<li><p>	<b>The Task State Segment.</b>
	The processor needs a place
	to save the <i>old</i> processor state
	before the interrupt or exception occurred,
	such as the original values of <tt>EIP</tt> and <tt>CS</tt>
	before the processor invoked the exception handler,
	so that the exception handler can later restore that old state
	and resume the interrupted code from where it left off.
	But this save area for the old processor state
	must in turn be protected from unprivileged user-mode code;
	otherwise buggy or malicious user code
	could compromise the kernel:
	for example, one user mode thread could change the kernel state
	of another thread while the latter is in a system call,
	or user code could simply point ESP to unmapped or read-only memory,
	making it impossible for the processor to push the trap frame
	and causing an immediate reset as described above.
	</p>

	<p>
	For this reason,
	when an x86 processor takes an interrupt or trap
	that causes a privilege level change from user to kernel mode,
        it also switches to a stack in the kernel's memory.
	A structure called the <i>task state segment</i> (TSS) specifies
	the segment selector and address where this stack lives.
	The processor pushes (on this new stack)
        <tt>SS</tt>, <tt>ESP</tt>, <tt>EFLAGS</tt>,
	<tt>CS</tt>, <tt>EIP</tt>, and an optional error code.
        Then it loads the <tt>CS</tt> and <tt>EIP</tt>
	from the interrupt descriptor,
	and sets the <tt>ESP</tt> and <tt>SS</tt> to refer to the new stack.
	</p>

	<p>
	Although the TSS is large
	and can potentially serve a variety of purposes,
	PIOS only uses it to define
	the kernel stack that the processor should switch to
	when it transfers from user to kernel mode.
	Since "kernel mode" in PIOS
	is privilege level 0 on the x86,
	the processor uses the <tt>ESP0</tt> and <tt>SS0</tt> fields of the TSS
	to define the kernel stack when entering kernel mode.
        PIOS doesn't use any other TSS fields.
	</p>
	</li>
</ol>

Combined,
the IDT and TSS provide the kernel with a mechanism
to ensure that traps are handled
only by calling well-defined entrypoints in the kernel
(the interrupt vectors in the IDT)
and that trap handlers will have a well-defined, protected workspace
(the stack pointers in the TSS).
Exactly <i>where</i> these entrypoints and kernel stacks are located
is up to the kernel,
however.

<h3>Kernel Stack Management</h3>

<p>
A particularly important kernel design issue is
<i>how many</i> kernel stacks there are,
and which OS abstraction they are associated with.
There are basically two common models:
<ul>
<li>	The xv6 kernel, like most Unix kernels, uses a <i>process model</i>:
	it associates a kernel stack with each user process,
	so that whenever the kernel is running
	on behalf of a particular process,
	it runs on that process's kernel stack,
	and it switches stacks whenever it switches between processes.

<li>	The PIOS kernel, in contrast, is an <i>interrupt model</i> kernel,
	which means it maintains one kernel stack per <i>physical CPU</i>,
	irrespective of the number of processes.
	Kernel code running on a given CPU always runs
	on that CPU's permanently-assigned kernel stack
	regardless of what user process is running,
	and kernel code thus never switches kernel stacks once it has booted.
	The downside of this simple design is that PIOS kernel code
	cannot use its stack to maintain any state on behalf
	of processes that are not currently running:
	if the kernel is working on behalf of a process
	and needs to put the process to sleep waiting on some event,
	the kernel must explicitly store all relevant information
	about what it was doing somewhere else,
	such as in the process control structure,
	or it would be lost when the kernel switches to another process.
</ul>

You will learn more about process versus interrupt model kernels
when we get into process management and scheduling in the next lab,
and for futher information you may wish to read about
some of the research operating systems
that have explored these design tradeoffs,
such as <a href="../bib/draves91continuations.pdf">Mach</a>
and <a href="../bib/ford99interface.pdf">Fluke</a>.

<p>
For now all you really need to know is that PIOS's kernel stack
is part of the <tt>cpu</tt> structure,
defined in <tt>kern/cpu.h</tt>:
it grows downwards (like all x86 stacks)
from <tt>kstackhi</tt> towards <tt>kstacklo</tt> in the structure.
Thus, the ESP field for ring 0 in a given processor's TSS
needs to point to <tt>kstackhi</tt>
in that processor's <tt>cpu</tt> structure.

<h3>An Example</h3>

<p>
Let's put the above pieces together and trace through an example.
Suppose the processor is executing code in user mode
and encounters a divide instruction that attempts to divide by zero.
</p>

<ol>
<li>	The processor switches to the stack defined by the
	<tt>SS0</tt> and <tt>ESP0</tt> fields of the TSS,
	which in PIOS will hold the values
	<code>CPU_GDT_KDATA</code> and <code>&cpu->kstackhi</code>,
	respectively.</li>

<li>	The processor pushes the following basic trap frame onto the
	kernel stack, starting at <code>kstackhi</code>:
	<pre>
                     +--------------------+ &cpu->kstackhi
                     | 0x00000 | old SS   |     " - 4
                     |      old ESP       |     " - 8
                     |     old EFLAGS     |     " - 12
                     | 0x00000 | old CS   |     " - 16
                     |      old EIP       |     " - 20 &lt;---- ESP 
                     +--------------------+  &lt;---- ESP
	</pre></li>

<li>	Because we're handling a divide error,
	which is interrupt vector 0 on the x86,
	the processor reads IDT entry 0 and sets
	<tt>CS:EIP</tt> to point to the handler function defined there.</li>

<li>	The handler function takes control and handles the exception,
	for example by terminating the user environment.</li>
</ol>

<p>
As you can see,
the trap frame the processor pushes on kernel entry from user
is similar to the one it pushes when it is <i>already</i> in the kernel,
except in this case the processor also pushes the SS and ESP registers
<i>before</i> pushing the frame
discussed in the preivous part of the lab.
You can see this difference reflected 
in the comments in the definition of <tt>trapframe</tt> in <tt>inc/trap.h</tt>,
and on the definitions of the <tt>trapframe_usize()</tt>
and <tt>trapframe_ksize()</tt> macros in the same header file.

<p>
For those traps for which the processor also pushes an error code
when taking a trap from kernel mode,
as discussed in the last part,
it pushes an error code in the same fashion for traps from user mode.
For these traps, therefore,
a trap from user mode will leave the kernel stack in the following state:
</p>

	<pre>
                     +--------------------+ &cpu->kstackhi
                     | 0x00000 | old SS   |     " - 4
                     |      old ESP       |     " - 8
                     |     old EFLAGS     |     " - 12
                     | 0x00000 | old CS   |     " - 16
                     |      old EIP       |     " - 20
                     |     error code     |     " - 24
                     +--------------------+  &lt;---- ESP            
	</pre>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 9.</span>
	Modify <tt>cpu_init()</tt>
	to set up the <tt>tss</tt> field
	in the <tt>cpu</tt> struct appropriately,
	and to create a TSS segment descriptor in the GDT pointing to it.
	The SEGDESC16 macro should make the latter part easy:
	note that you can use this macro in an assignment statement,
	as in '<samp>c->gdt[...] = SEGDESC16(...)</samp>'.
	A GDT entry for the TSS named <tt>CPU_GDT_TSS</tt>
	has already been reserved in <tt>kern/cpu.h</tt>.

	<p>
	Then, at the end of <tt>cpu_init()</tt>,
	after the processor's GDT is loaded,
	load your TSS into the processor using the LTR instruction.
	For convenience,
	there is an <tt>ltr()</tt> function in <tt>inc/x86.h</tt>.
	Make sure your code "accepts" your TSS descriptor:
	if it doesn't, the LTR instruction will cause a trap,
	which the kernel probably won't handle very well
	because <tt>trap_init()</tt> hasn't yet been called at this point.
</p></div>

<h3>Entering User Mode</h3>

<p>
What piece of register state in the processor
actually defines which privilege level it is executing in at a given moment?
Many architectures use a "kernel mode" flag in a control register of some kind,
but x86 processors uses the low two bits of the CS register,
effectively treating privilege level as a property
of the currently running code segment.

<p>
To enter user mode,
we might be tempted simply to take the kernel's code segment selector,
<samp>CPU_GDT_KCODE</samp>,
set the bottom two bits to 1,
and do an <tt>ljmp</tt> to that code segment
much like <tt>cpu_init()</tt> does to load <tt>CPU_GDT_KCODE</tt>
as a kernel-mode code segment.
Unfortunately, this doesn't work: <i>why?</i>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 10.</span>
	Modify the definition of <tt>cpu_boot</tt> in <tt>kern/cpu.c</tt>
	to create code and data segments for user mode.
	Other than privilege level,
	these segments should be identical
	to the corresponding kernel segments:
	we aren't going to do any address translation
	or memory protection for now.
</p></div>

<p>
We described above how the processor <i>leaves</i> user mode
and enters the kernel via a trap,
but how does the kernel <i>enter</i> user in the first place?
Simple: the kernel "returns" to user mode -
even if the processor has never been there before!

<p>
When the processor executes an <tt>iret</tt> instruction,
it pops its standard trap frame off the stack starting with the old EIP,
but it doesn't actually know or care
whether <i>it</i> actually pushed that frame on the stack
or if it got there some other way.
Thus, the kernel can always <i>manufacture</i> a trap frame
representing whatever user mode state it wants to load into the processor,
and "return" from it via <tt>iret</tt> to enter user mode.
(There are other ways to switch to user mode on the x86,
but this is the most general method.)

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 11.</span>
	Modify the code at the end of <tt>init()</tt>
	to cause the <tt>user()</tt> function to be run in user mode,
	instead of just calling it as a procedure like the skeleton code does,
	which leaves the processor in kernel mode.
	To do this, you will need to create and set up
	a <tt>trapframe</tt> struct correctly,
	and call <tt>trap_return()</tt> to "return" to it.
	The user mode code will need a stack,
	which must be separate from the kernel stack
	since the kernel stack will be used for trap handling:
	we have defined an array called <tt>user_stack</tt> for this purpose.

	<p>
	<b>Note:</b>
	You should make sure the processor enters user mode
	with the I/O privilege level set to 3,
	by setting the <tt>FL_IOPL_MASK</tt> bits in the EFLAGS register
	to the value <tt>FL_IOPL_3</tt>.
	This will allow console output,
	such as the <tt>cprintf()</tt> at the beginning of <tt>user()</tt>,
	to work even from user mode for debugging purposes.
	We would not want to do this for ordinary applications,
	since that would give them unrestricted access to the PC's I/O space:
	we will later provide a way for user mode code code
	to produce output in a controlled fashion via system calls.

	<p>
	You should now see <tt>user()</tt> print '<tt>in user()</tt>'
	from user mode: verify that you're really in user mode here
	by setting a GDB breakpoint at <tt>user</tt>
	and looking at the CS register at that point.
</p></div>

<h3>Software Interrupts</h3>

<p>
Now that your kernel has basic exception handling capabilities
and can enter user mode,
you will refine it to handle traps
that user mode code may cause deliberately for various purposes;
we refer to such traps as <i>software interrupts</i>.
There are two traps defined by the x86 processor
expressly to serve as software interrupts,
and PIOS defines a third one to serve as its system call mechanism:

<ul>
<li>	<tt>T_BRKPT</tt>:
	The breakpoint exception,
	interrupt vector 3,
	is normally used to allow debuggers
	to insert breakpoints in a program's code
	by temporarily replacing the relevant program instruction
	with the special 1-byte <code>int3</code>
	software interrupt instruction.

<li>	<tt>T_OFLOW</tt>:
	The overflow exception,
	interrupt vector 4,
	allows software to generate a trap deliberately
	via the special <code>into</code> software interrupt instruction,
	if the overflow flag (FL_OF) is set when the instruction executes.
	The intent is for software to execute an <tt>into</tt>
	after an arithmetic operation that might overflow:
	if it doesn't, execution proceeds normally,
	but if it does, the overflow condition is immediately caught.
	This appealing idea has never really caught on
	in high-level languages, however, and is rarely used.
	Nevertheless, on principle we want to ensure that PIOS
	can handle <tt>into</tt> instructions in applications properly.

<li>	<tt>T_SYSCALL</tt>:
	This value defined in <tt>inc/trap.h</tt>
	is <i>not</i> one of the 32 defined by the x86 architecture,
	but is somewhat arbitrarily assigned by PIOS to be 48 (0x30),
	one of the higher vectors in the 256-vector space.
	PIOS application code will invoke this trap vector
	deliberately with the <tt>int</tt> instruction
	when it wishes to make an explicit system call to the kernel.
	This is the classic way to perform system calls on the x86.
</ul>

We do not want user code to be able to invoke
<i>just any</i> interrupt vector in the IDT deliberately
via <tt>int</tt> instructions, however:
that might allow user code to confuse the kernel
into thinking that some special event has occurred when it has not.
For this reason,
all IDT descriptors have a <i>descriptor privilege level</i>
indicating what privilege level is required
for software to invoke that interrupt vector deliberately
via a software interrupt instruction.
Most of these vectors are normally set to "privileged" (ring 0),
but we want the vectors used for software interrupts
to be set so user mode code can invoke them.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 12.</span>
	Modify <code>trap_init_idt()</code>
	to allow user mode code to invoke
	the <tt>T_BRKPT</tt> and <tt>T_OFLOW</tt> vectors
	via software interrupt instructions.
	Don't worry about <tt>T_SYSCALL</tt> for now;
	we'll do that in the next lab
	when we start implementing useful system calls.

	<p>
	The call from <tt>user()</tt> to <tt>trap_check()</tt> in user mode
	should now succeed,
	and you should be able to get <kbd>make grade</kbd>
	to succeed on the user mode test.

<h2>Part 4: Physical Page Allocation</h2>

<p>
The operating system must keep track of
which parts of physical RAM are free
and which are currently in use.
The final part of this lab is to construct
a physical memory allocator for the kernel,
so that the kernel can dynamically allocate memory and later free it.
Before starting this part of the lab,
be sure you have read and understood
the part about memory allocation in
<a href="../book-rev6.pdf">xv6 chapter 2</a>.

<p>
Your allocator will operate in units of 4096 bytes, called
<i>pages</i>.
Pages will become highly relevant in lab 3,
where you will implement virtual memory,
but for now take it on faith that pages
are useful units of allocation in kernels.
Your task will be to maintain data structures that record
which physical pages are free and which are
allocated, and how many users there are of each allocated page.
You will also write the routines to allocate and free pages of memory.

<p>
Dividing up physical memory into pages of exactly equal size
will make memory allocation in the PIOS kernel substantially simpler
than it is in xv6,
or any user-level implementation of <code>malloc()</code>
for that matter,
because you won't have to deal with the problems
of fragmentation or searching for a sufficiently large free chunk
to fill a request for a given amount of memory.
This design simplicity has its costs:
namely, the rest of the kernel will not have any way
to allocate physically contiguous memory
for structures larger than a page after the kernel boots.
As it turns out, the PIOS kernel will not <i>need</i>
to allocate any data structures larger than a page after it boots.
But even some much more complex kernels - Linux, for example -
impose restrictions such as this
to keep their physical memory allocators simple and fast,
and work around these limitations using virtual memory
to make physically discontiguous memory appear virtually contiguous
to the kernel code using that memory.
</p>

<p>
You'll now write the physical page allocator.  It keeps track of which
pages are free with a linked list of <code>pageinfo</code> structures,
each corresponding to a physical page.
</p>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 13.</span>
	In the file <tt>kern/mem.c</tt>,
	you must implement code for the following functions.</p>

	<pre>
	mem_init()
	mem_alloc()
	mem_free()
	</pre>

	<p>
	We have provided a function in the same source file,
	<code>mem_check()</code>, which tests your physical page allocator.
        You should boot PIOS and see whether <code>mem_check()</code>
        reports success. Fix your code so that it passes. You may find it
        helpful to add your own <code>assert()</code>s to verify that
        your assumptions are correct.
	Our checking code is certainly not guaranteed
	to detect every possible bug,
	and any bugs your code has that it does <i>not</i> detect
	may easily come back to bite you in a future lab!
</p></div>

<p>
This lab, and all the labs in this course, will require you to do a bit of
detective work to figure out exactly what you need to do. This
assignment does not describe all the details of the code you'll have
to add to the kernel.  Look for comments in the parts of the PIOS source that
you have to modify; those comments often contain specifications and
hints.  You will also need to look at related parts of PIOS, at the
Intel manuals, and perhaps at your notes from relevant courses
you may have taken previously such as CSL211.

<b>This completes the lab.</b>
