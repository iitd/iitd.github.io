<h1>Scalable locks</h1>

<p>Required reading: Mellor-Crummey and Scott, Algorithms for Scalable
  Synchronization on Shared-Memory Multiprocessors, TOCS, Feb 1991.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Sequent Symmetry has up to 32 CPUs, all on the same bus, and
  uses a cache-coherence protocol to keep caches consistent.  It's
  similar to what common processor implement on a single chip, and
  current CC protocol is like the Symmetry one, but has an
  additional state (exclusive).

<h2>x86 memory model</h2>

<pre>
why are we reading this paper?
    multi-processor systems becoming quite common; hard to buy a single-core laptop
    want to use multiple CPUs to improve performance
    synchronization between CPUs often expensive (performance-wise) and tricky
    scalability limitations of kernel-provided services passed onto all applications
    let's briefly look back at the x86 memory system to understand what's slow..

back in the locking lecture, we had a fairly simple model of multiple CPUs
    shared bus
    memory connected to bus
    to implement acquire, x86's xchg instruction locked the bus
    provided atomicity for xchg

in reality things are a bit different
    bus, memory quite slow compared to CPU speed
    each CPU has a few levels of cache to compensate
    each CPU directly attached to a part of the system's memory (AMD, recent Intels)
    recent AMD chip:
	cache latency ~10's of cycles
	going over bus to DRAM or another CPU is ~500 cycles
    need to make sure xchg still atomic with all these caches, and performs well
    x86 uses caching system to provide fast atomic ops

what's in a cache line?
    state, address, 64 bytes of data
    states: Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid [MESI]
    compatibility of states between 2 CPUs:

		   CPU1
		  M E S I
		M - - - +
	CPU2	E - - - +
		S - - + +
		I + + + +

how do the CPUs coordinate with each other?
    each CPU listens on bus for address requests, looks up in cache, responds
	"read address"
	"read and invalidate address"
	"invalidate address"
    atomicity: hold cacheline while executing xchg, don't give it to other CPUs
</pre>

<p>Our basic estimator of performance for locking algorithms will be
the number of bus transactions, since they are so much slower than
local cache reads/writes.


<h2>Scalable locks</h2>

<p>This paper is about cost and scalability of locking; what if you
have 10 CPUs waiting for the same lock?  For example, what would
happen if xv6 runs on an SMP with many processors?

<p>What's the cost of a simple spinning acquire/release?  Algorithm 1
*without* the delays, which is like xv6's implementation of acquire
and release (xv6 uses XCHG instead of test_and_set):
<pre>
  each of the 10 CPUs gets the lock in turn
  meanwhile, remaining CPUs in XCHG on lock
  lock must be X in cache to run XCHG
    otherwise all might read, then all might write
  so bus is busy all the time with XCHGs!
    gets in the way of the lock-holder doing real work
  can we avoid constant XCHGs while lock is held?
</pre>

<p>test-and-test-and-set
<pre>
  only run expensive TSL if not locked
  spin on ordinary load, so cache line is S, so no bus xaction
  acquire(l)
    while(1){
      while(l->locked != 0) { }
      if(TSL(&l->locked) == 0)
        return;
    }
</pre>

<p>suppose 10 CPUs are waiting, let's count cost in total bus
  transactions
<pre>
  CPU1 gets lock in one cycle
    sets lock's cache line to I in other CPUs
  9 CPUs each use bus once in XCHG
    then everyone has the line S, so they spin locally
  CPU1 release the lock
  CPU2 gets the lock in one cycle
  8 CPUs each use bus once...
  So 10 + 9 + 8 + ... = 50 transactions, O(n^2) in # of CPUs!
  Look at "test-and-test-and-set" in Figure 6
</pre>

<p>What's the minimum number of bus xactions we can reasonably
hope for in order to have n CPUs each acquire a lock?

<p>What is the point of the exponential backoff in Algorithm 1?
<pre>
  What does Figure 6 say about its scalability?
  Why does it work well?
  How many bus transactions do we expect?
  Is there anything wrong with it?
  may not be fair
  exponential backoff may increase delay after release
</pre>

<p>What's the point of the ticket locks, Algorithm 2?
<pre>
  one interlocked instruction to get my ticket number
  then I spin on now_serving with ordinary load
  release() just increments now_serving
</pre>

<p>why is that good?
<pre>
  + fair
  + no exponential backoff overshoot
  + no spinning on XCHG
</pre>

<p>but what's the cost, in bus transactions?
<pre>
  while lock is held, now_serving is S in all caches
  release makes it I in all caches
  then each waiters uses a bus transaction to get new value
  so still O(n^2)
</pre>

<p>So why does Figure 5 show that the ticket algorithm has basically
O(n) cost?

<p>Do we believe it's reasonable to predict lock hold times?

<p>What's the point of the array-based queuing locks, Algorithm 3?
<pre>
    a lock has an array of "slots"
    waiter allocates a slot, spins on that slot
    release wakes up just next slot
  three bus transactions per locker:
    allocate slot, read "has_lock" from slot, write "has_lock" to next slot
  so O(n) bus transactions to get through n waiters: good!
  anderson lines in Figure 4 and 6 are flat-ish
    they only go up because lock data structures protected by simpler lock
  no delay() , so no requirement to predict lock hold times
  BUT O(n) space *per lock*!
</pre>

<p>Algorithm 5 (MCS), the new algorithm of the paper, uses
compare_and_swap (CMPXCHG on x86):
<pre>
int compare_and_swap(addr, v1, v2) {
  int ret = 0;
  // stop all memory activity and ignore interrupts
  if (*addr == v1) {
    *addr = v2;
    ret = 1;
  }
  // resume other memory activity and take interrupts
  return ret;
}
</pre>

<p>How does the MCS lock (Algorithm 5) work?
<pre>
  one "qnode" per thread, used for whatever lock it's waiting for
  lock holder's qnode points to start of list
  lock variable points to end of list
  acquire() adds your qnode to end of list
    then you spin on your own qnode
  release() wakes up next qnode
</pre>

<p>How much space per MCS lock? 

<p>How many bus transactions for n CPUs to acquire an MCS lock?

<p>Does Figure 6 show that MCS is worthwhile?

<p>Suppose there is <b>not</b> contention for a lock. Which of
these algorithms will be fastest?

<p>
Remember the point of locks was to synchronize updates to shared data
structures. Since the data are shared, and mutable, we have to worry
about the same scalability issues all over again for the data that
locks protect! This is critical in real life and leads to careful
attention to how data is split over cache lines.
