<h1>xv6 file system</h1>

<p>
<b>Read</b>: sysfile.c (create(), sys_unlink()),
fs.c (readi(), writei(), dirlink(), ialloc(), iupdate(), iget(), ilock(), iunlock(),
iput(), itrunc()), bio.c (bget(), bread(), bwrite(), brelse())

<p>
<b> Add the following line at the beginning of the log_write() function in log.c</b>
<pre>
cprintf("log_write %d\n", b->sector);
</pre>
This will record all writes to the file system along with the sector number.

<p>
Start a new session on xv6 with a fresh disk (using <code>make clean</code> followed
by <code>make qemu</code>, and type the following command:
<pre>
$ echo > a
</pre>
This command creates a new file.
You will see a series of disk writes (printed in log_write()).
<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Turn in:</span>
Report the printed output and explain what is being written in each disk write.
What is the third disk write (to sector
29)? You may want to insert <code>cprintf()</code> statements in xv6 code to
see where the writes are coming from.
</p></div>

<p>
Interrupt the previous command (leave the newly created file unchanged).
Next, execute the following command to write data to this file:
<pre>
$ echo x > a
</pre>
<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Turn in:</span>
Report the printed output and explain what is being written in each disk write.
Why do you see writes to block 4 (and to 426) twice? You may want to
insert <code>cprintf()</code> statements in xv6 code to
see where the writes are coming from.
</p></div>

<p>
Next, delete the file by typing the following command:
<pre>
$ rm a
</pre>
<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Turn in:</span>
Report the printed output and explain what is being written in each disk write.
</p></div>
