<h1>Homework: virtual memory</h1>
<p><h2>Assignment Part 1</h2>
On x86 using 4KB pages only, we wish to map virtual address 0x80100000 to
physical address 0x00100000 with read-only permissions. Assume that all segments
are setup to [0:0xffffffff] and use only paging. You will need to describe the
offset at which the page directory
and the page table need to be modified and to what values.

<p><h2>Assignment Part 2</h2>
Let's look at the page table (kpgdir) that setupkvm produces
<pre>
(gdb) break kvmalloc
(gdb) next
(gdb) print/x kpgdir[0]
why is this zero?

let's look up a virtual address
how about the first instruction of kvmalloc
(gdb) x/i kvmalloc
0x80107990 <kvmalloc>:  push   %ebp
how would we translate 0x80107990 to a physical address?

(gdb) print/x 0x80107990 >> 22
$4 = 0x200
(gdb) print/x kpgdir[0x200]
$6 = 0x114007
Q: what is this?
Q: what is the PPN?
Q: what does the 7 mean?
(gdb) print/x (0x80107990 >> 12) & 0xfff
$6 = 0x107
(gdb) print/x ((int*)0x114000)[0x107]
$12 = 0x107001
Q: what is this?
Q: why 1 in the low bits?
(gdb) print/x 0x107000 + 0x990
$13 = 0x107990
(gdb) x/i 0x107990

why did the physical address work in gdb?

back to kvmalloc
it called setupkvm to create a page table
now it calls switchkvm to start using it
switchkvm loads kpgdir into %cr3

and now 0x170990 won't work:
(gdb) x/i 0x107990
0x107990:       Cannot access memory at address 0x107990

why?
</pre>


<p><h2>Assignment Part 3</h2></p>
Suppose you wanted bootmain() to load the kernel at 0x80200000 instead of
0x80100000, and you did so by modifying bootmain() to add 0x100000 to the va/pa of each
ELF section. Something would go wrong. What?

<p><h2>Assignment Part 4 (pintos submissions)</h2>
You should have submitted Lab1 by now using <code>submit-lab1</code> script.
<p>
You should now checkout the <code>pintos</code> source code using:
<pre>
svn checkout https://svn.iitd.ernet.in/~sbansal/pintos-repo
</pre>
Next, you should submit the base version of pintos
using <code>csl373-submit-pintos</code> script (we need that you submit the base
version to be able to correctly submit your next lab). You will need to
create a Subversion repository for yourself to do this. See
instructions on the <a href=../tools.html>tools</a> page for instructions
on using Subversion.

<p>On successful submission, you should have seen a "Congratulations"
message with your submission ID if your submission
was successful. At any time, you can check if your submission
has been made by typing
"<code>csl373-get-submission <user-id> base</code>". For
future assignments just replace <code>base</code>
with <code>userprog</code>, <code>vm</code>, etc.
The <code>csl373-get-submission</code> script should
create a directory with your submission-id. This directory
should contain a <code>submit.note</code> file.

<p>You should build your solution to Lab2 (<code>userprog</code>)
on top of the base pintos version that you submitted. We
encourage you to use the
SVN repository actively during development. Use good and
illustrative commit messages. We will examine your repository
log during demos.

<p>Study the grading policy on the
<a href=../administrivia.html>Administrivia</a> page. You
can check your current score using <code>csl373-score</code>
script. In case of multiple submissions by the
same person/group, we will use the date
of your <em>last</em>
submission to compute the late days. Notice that
late days are counted at the granularity of hours.
So if you are late by 4 hours for <code>Lab1</code>
and late by 5 hours for <code>Lab2</code>, your total late "days" is
only 9 hours (not 2 days).
Nothing to turn in for this part.
