<h1>CSL373 Lab 4: Files and I/O</h1>
<p>
<b>Handed out Tuesday, February 28, 2011<br />

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
In this lab,
you will add support for interactive console input/output
and a file system abstraction to PIOS,
enabling the implementation of basic Unix-style shells
and other command-line programs.
Unlike conventionl Unix-like operating systems, however,
PIOS's file system will be implemented mostly in user mode,
as part of the minimal C library that gets linked into PIOS applications.
Each PIOS process will effectively contain its own file system,
whose state resides in the process's virtual address space
rather than on disk,
and different PIOS processes will use file synchronization techniques
to propagate file system updates among processes,
much as if each process were a separate node in a small distributed system.
Contrary to one of the basic purposes of file systems
in a conventional operating system,
PIOS's file system for now will <i>not</i> provide persistence &mdash;
the ability for state to survive crashes or reboots &mdash;
although we will add persistence of sorts to PIOS in Lab 5.

<p>
This lab contains the following parts:

<ol>
<li>	<b>A Per-Process File System in User Space:</b>
	Filling out the implementation of a simple Unix-like file system
	whose state resides in the same process as the application using it.

<li>	<b>Console Input/Output:</b>
	Adding interrupt-driven console input support to the PIOS kernel,
	and giving the root process access to console I/O
	via its file system API.

<li>	<b>Fork/Exec and Command-Line Arguments:</b>
	Enabling one user-level PIOS program to load and execute another,
	and pass command-line arguments to the new program.

<li>	<b>File System Reconciliation:</b>
	Synchronizing file system state between processes,
	so that processes can interact through a common logical file system
	and share the root process's file-based console access.
</ol>

<h3>Software Setup</h3>
<p>

In this lab you will build on the kernel from lab 3.
Use the same procedure as in the previous lab
to create a <tt>lab4</tt> branch in your Git repository,
fetch our skeleton source code for lab 3 from the master Git repository,
and merge your lab3 solutions into it as your starting point for lab 4:
</p>
<pre>
$ <kbd>cd lab</kbd>
$ <kbd>git commit -am 'my solution to lab3'</kbd>
$ <kbd>git pull</kbd>
$ <kbd>git checkout -b lab3 origin/lab4</kbd>
$ <kbd>git merge lab3</kbd>
</pre>

<p>
Lab 4 contains a number of new source files.
The following are the most important ones,
which contain the skeletons for the Unix-style
file system and process management facilities
you will be working on in this lab;
you should first look through them carefully:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table> <tr>
<tr><td><tt>inc/file.h</tt>
	<td>Definitions describing file system and process management metadata.
<tr><td><tt>kern/file.{c,h}</tt>
	<td>Kernel module to set up the root process's file system
	    and synchronize it to provide general-purpose I/O.
<tr><td><tt>lib/file.c</tt>
	<td>Core functions for user-level file system management.
<tr><td><tt>lib/fork.c</tt>

		and file system reconciliation.
<tr><td><tt>lib/exec.c</tt>
	<td>User-level implementation of Unix-style
		program loading and execution.
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
The other new files mostly consist of additional C library infrastructure
and some user-level programs to run on your kernel;
you should browse through them briefly to get a sense
for what's there and how they relate to each other:

<h2>Part 1: A Per-Process File System in User Space</h2>

<p>
In conventional operating systems,
the file system is a primary kernel storage abstraction
that is globally shared by all processes,
which programs can use both to store persistent state across crashes or reboots
and as a channel for interprocess communication
(i.e., one process writes a file, then another process reads it).
PIOS takes a radically different approach:
the PIOS kernel provides <i>no</i> file-related system calls,
and the "file system" as seen by PIOS applications
is really just some state in a portion of
a given process's virtual address space,
together with some C library functions
that know how to access and manipulate that state
so as to make it look roughly like a Unix-style file system API.
PIOS adopts the philosophy,
<i>a file system is whatever looks to applications like a file system</i>:
i.e., what matters directly to most applications
is that a conventional-looking file API is available
providing functions like
<tt>open</tt>, <tt>close</tt>, <tt>read</tt>, and <tt>write</tt>,
and not how exactly that API is implemented.

<table align="right" cellpadding=10>
<tr><td align="center"><img src="fsorg.png">
<tr><td align="center"><b>File system architecture in
	conventional monolothic systems, conventional microkernels,
	and PIOS's "distributed system in one machine."</b>
</table>

<p>
To provide some background perspective,
many microkernel-based operating systems have made the design choice
of implementing the file system in user space rather than in the kernel
as it is in Unix: e.g.,
<a href="../bib/accetta86mach.pdf">Mach</a>,
<a href="../bib/bomberger92keykos.pdf">KeyKOS</a>,
etc.
In such microkernel designs,
the file system still generally acts as a globally shared service,
usually implemented by a special process or group of processes
and accessed by other, "normal" application processes
via interprocess communication (IPC).

<p>
PIOS takes this decentralization of the classic file system abstraction
still one step further,
such that processes no longer share access
to a global file system at all.
Instead, each PIOS process contains its own local copy
of all file system state,
and changes that one process makes to its local copy of the file system
are not seen at all by other processes
until two processes explicitly synchronize with each other
and propagate or <i>reconcile</i> their file system updates.
In effect, each PIOS process behaves like its own "node"
in a small "distributed system",
with all of these process/nodes crammed into one physical machine.
Each process/node maintains its own file system replica
for local use by the process itself,
and propagates its changes from one replica to another
only when processes synchronize via events
such as <tt>fork</tt> and <tt>wait</tt>.
See the figure for an illustration
contrasting the Unix/xv6 approach, the conventional microkernel approach,
and the PIOS "distributed system in a system" approach.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
	Study <tt>inc/vm.h</tt> and <tt>inc/file.h</tt>
	to understand how file system state is structured
	within each process's address space.
	In particular, make sure you understand
	exactly what the '<tt>files</tt>' global variable points to
	(this variable never changes, although what it points to does),
	where it is located in each process's virtual address space,
	and where the actual content of a given file
	(as opposed to the file's inode metadata such as size mode)
	resides in a process's address space.
</p></div>

The structure of PIOS's in-memory file system and file API
is simplified in several respects from that of a Unix file system,
even discounting the huge difference that PIOS's file system
doesn't actually read or write a real disk.
For one thing, PIOS does not implement file descriptor sharing
in the same way that Unix does:
you can duplicate a file descriptor via <tt>dup()</tt> or <tt>dup2()</tt>
as in Unix (see <tt>lib/unistd.c</tt>),
but in PIOS each of the duplicated file descriptors
will have its own file offset and other state from that point on,
unlike Unix in which duplicated file descriptors
continue to share per-open state such as the file offset.
Another difference is that in PIOS,
a file's name is contained in the file's inode ('<tt>fileinode</tt>' struct)
rather than in the data content of a "directory file" as in Unix.
Also, each PIOS inode has a '<tt>dino</tt>' element (<i>directory inode</i>)
containing the inode number of the directory containing this file.
The <tt>dino</tt> essentially acts as a "back-link" to the directory
containing <i>any</i> entry, whether directory or reguler file.
(The root directory's <tt>dino</tt> back-link just points back to itself,
as if the root directory "contains itself.")
These structural differences effectively mean that
PIOS cannot support Unix-style hard links,
since a hard linked file can have several "containing directories" in Unix,
and possibly different filenames in each.
Make sure you understand
how the <tt>fileinode</tt> and <tt>filedesc</tt> structs work,
and the implications of these design decisions
in contrast with xv6's file system design.


<h3>Giving the Root Process an Initial File System</h3>

Your first programming task in this lab is to give the root process &mdash;
the one and only process that the PIOS kernel itself starts
in <tt>init()</tt> &mdash;
with an initial file system image,
from which the root process can read a few files
that we have arranged to be bundled into the kernel on bootstrap.
The files populating this initial file system
will simply come from binary "blobs" linked into the kernel itself,
in the same way the <tt>user/testvm</tt> program was in lab 3.

<p>
Since we will want to include several files in the initial file system,
and this list of files will grow in subsequent labs,
we need a more automated way to link copies of these files into the kernel
and implement the kernel logic to populate the initial file system.
We have provided a bit of magic in <tt>kern/Makefrag</tt>
to create an automatically-generated header file <tt>obj/kern/initfiles.h</tt>,
which just contains a series of statements of the form
<tt>INITFILE(<i>filename</i>)</tt>,
one for each file that the root process's initial file system should contain.
The kernel's <tt>Makefrag</tt> links these files into the kernel automatically,
and the top of <tt>kern/file.c</tt> contains
some ugly but useful preprocessor magic
that uses the automatically-generated <tt>obj/kern/initfiles.h</tt>
to build a table listing the names of each of these initial files,
and the start and end addresses at which they are linked into the kernel.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
	Carefully examine, then complete the <tt>file_initroot()</tt> function
	in <tt>kern/file.c</tt>.
	This function sets up the root file system image for the root process.
	We have provided most of its implementation for you,
	including code to set up several "special" files and file descriptors,
	such as the console input/output files described later
	and the inode representing the root directory.
	You'll need to write only one small piece of code,
	to populate the root process's initial file system
	from the <tt>initfiles</tt> table
	so that the root process has some regular files to start with.

	<p>
	To check the contents of your initial file system,
	modify your <tt>init()</tt> function in <tt>kern/init.c</tt>
	to use the preprocessor symbol <tt>ROOTEXE_START</tt>,
	instead of the hard-coded symbol
	<tt>_binary_obj_user_testvm_start</tt> as in the last lab,
	to find the ELF executable to load and run in the root process.
	You'll notice that at the top of <tt>kern/init.c</tt>
	we've made <tt>ROOTEXE_START</tt> default to
	running a new program, <tt>user/testfs</tt>,
	in the root process.
	Once you've written the code to populate the initial file system,
	<tt>user/testfs</tt> should dump a list of the files
	in the initial file system,
	and then report '<tt>initfilecheck passed</tt>'.
</p></div>


<h3>File I/O via a Unix-Compatible API</h3>

The <tt>initfilecheck()</tt> function in <tt>user/testfs</tt>
checks the root process's initial file system
simply by digging directly into the file system metadata
via the global <tt>files</tt> pointer.
While accessing the file system this way
happens to be easy given that all the file system's state
is in the root process's virtual memory,
the main point of having a file system abstraction
is to allow applications to access that abstraction
through a familiar, standard, well-defined API,
such as Unix's <tt>open</tt>/<tt>close</tt>/<tt>read</tt>/<tt>write</tt> API.
We have implemented most of this API for you,
mainly in <tt>lib/file.c</tt> and <tt>lib/dir.c</tt>,
with some supporting "wrapper" functions
in <tt>lib/unistd.c</tt> and <tt>lib/stdio.c</tt>.
You'll need to implement only a few small but key functions:
reading or writing a file's content given the file's inode number,
seeking within a file,
and scanning the contents of a directory.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>
	Implement the functions
	<tt>fileino_read()</tt> and <tt>fileino_write()</tt>
	in <tt>lib/file.c</tt>,
	which respectively read from and write to files
	in the per-process file system.
	Notice that these are in fact just "helper functions"
	called by <tt>filedesc_read()</tt> and <tt>filedesc_write()</tt>
	further down in the same source file,
	and those functions are called in turn
	by the "real" file system API functions,
	<tt>read()</tt> and <tt>write()</tt> in <tt>lib/unistd.c</tt>,
	and <tt>fread()</tt> and <tt>fwrite()</tt> in <tt>lib/stdio.c</tt>.
	Be sure you understand the relationship between all these functions
	and exactly what the "top-level" functions are supposed to do
	(type <samp>man read</samp>, etc., under Linux
	for a detailed description),
	before you implement them.

	<p>
	<i>Hint:</i>
	When implementing <tt>filedesc_write()</tt>,
	note that you're responsible for managing the permissions
	of the virtual address region containing the file's content.
	Each file's 4MB data area starts with no permissions on any page,
	so you'll have to adjust these page permissions
	in order to read and write file data.
	While you can manage page permissions any way that works,
	one approach amenable to catching accidental bugs might be
	to maintain the invariant that <i>only</i> pages containing
	actual file data ever have non-zero permissions;
	the implementation of <tt>fileino_truncate()</tt> we provided
	follows this invariant.

	<p>
	Once you have the reading and writing implemented and working,
	you should be able to pass the <tt>readwritecheck</tt>
	in <tt>user/testfs</tt>.
</p></div>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 4.</span>
	Implement the function <tt>filedesc_seek()</tt>
	in <tt>lib/file.c</tt>.
	This function is called by both
	<tt>lseek()</tt> in <tt>lib/unistd.c</tt>
	and <tt>fseek()</tt> in <tt>lib/stdio.c</tt>.
	Again, refer to the Linux or other Unix man pages
	for precise details on how these API functions should work.

	<p>
	Once you have seek implemented,
	you should be able to pass the <tt>seekcheck</tt>
	in <tt>user/testfs</tt>.
</p></div>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 5.</span>
	Implement the function <tt>readdir()</tt>
	in <tt>lib/dir.c</tt>,
	which scans a directory and returns the entries it contains,
	one at a time.
	You'll need to use the <tt>ofs</tt> field
	of the <tt>filedesc</tt> structure (aka <tt>DIR</tt>)
	to keep track of the current "position" in the directory,
	although in this case it does not represent a byte offset
	as it would in a file descriptor for a regular file.

	<p>
	Once you have directory scanning implemented,
	you should be able to pass the <tt>readdircheck</tt>
	in <tt>user/testfs</tt>.
</p></div>


<h2>Part 2: Console Input/Output</h2>

In this part of the lab we will make it possible
for processes running on PIOS &mdash;
starting with the root process &mdash;
to interact with the user via simple text-based console input/output.
PIOS already provides the <tt>cputs</tt> system call
for console output, of course,
but we intend this system call to be used purely for debugging:
output written this way always goes directly to the console
and cannot be redirected to a file or intercepted by a parent process,
for example.
We would like a more general-purpose device input/output facility.
In particular, when applications are performing normal input/output,
we would like them to follow the Unix tradition of API consistency:
providing a single, common file system API for file and device I/O,
regardless of whether a particular read or write
happens to be to or from a device such as the console,
or a flat file such as an input script or output log file.

<p>
For general-purpose I/O, therefore,
PIOS processes will use the user-level <tt>read</tt>/<tt>write</tt> API
you started filling out above.
But since regular files in PIOS's file system
are just part of the process's address space,
how can they provide any capability for communication
with entities <i>outside</i> the process's address space,
such as the console device drivers in the PIOS kernel?
The answer is that they don't provide any external I/O capability at all
while the process is just running on its own normally &mdash;
but when a process forks or synchronizes with a child
or with its parent process,
at <i>those specific synchronization points</i>
we will arrange for I/O to propagate
across these parent/child relationships,
essentially by copying file data from the file system in one process
to the file system in its immediate parent or child process.

<table align="right" cellpadding=10>
<tr><td align="center"><img src="consio.png">
<tr><td align="center"><b>File system architecture in
	Propagation of console input/output among PIOS processes</b>
</table>

<p>
To support console I/O, we've reserved two file inodes,
<tt>FILEINO_CONSIN</tt> and <tt>FILEINO_CONSOUT</tt>
for "special" console input and output files
to provide external I/O capability.
All of the processes in the PIOS system will "agree upon"
the special meanings of these two special files.
We have given these special files the names
'<tt>consin</tt>' and '<tt>consout</tt>' in the file system's root directory:
you should see them in the root directory listings you got above
while implementing directory scanning.
Like regular files, the content of these files
will reside in the 4MB address region reserved for that file's inode slot
in a given process.
The <tt>consin</tt> file in a given process will accumulate
all the input that process or any of its children have ever received
from the console,
and the <tt>consout</tt> file in a process will accumulate
all the output that process and its children have written to the console.
In particular, all console input for the whole system
is first delivered by the PIOS kernel
to the root process's special <tt>consin</tt> file,
and the root process may either "consume" that console input itself
or deliver some or all of it in turn to the <tt>consin</tt> files
of its child processes.
Similarly,
any process's console output first collects
in the process's own <tt>consout</tt> file;
then when the process returns to or synchronizes with its parent,
the parent copies any new console output from the child
into its own <tt>consout</tt> file,
and console output propagates in this way toward the root process
and eventually to the external world via the PIOS kernel.
The figure to the right illustrates this propagation of I/O
in among the processes in a PIOS system.

<p>
In this part of the lab,
we will for now be concerned only with
console I/O interaction between the PIOS kernel and the root process.
We will take care of console I/O propagation
between processes later in part 4 of the lab.

<h3>Explicit Parent/Child Synchronization</h3>

<p>
Up to this point,
processes have generally returned to their parent process
(or to the PIOS kernel in the case of the root process)
when they were "done", for better or worse &mdash;
i.e., when they completed their assigned task and wish to terminate,
or when they encounter a fatal exception
and are "forced" by the PIOS kernel to return to their parent.
There is no reason in PIOS why such a "return"
necessarily has to be fatal to the child, however.

<p>
We will now change this convention,
so that a process may "return" to its parent
any time it wishes to perform I/O or interact with its parent for any reason.
Normally the expectation will be that on such a return,
the parent process synchronizes and propagates any outstanding I/O
between itself and the child,
then restarts execution in the child from where it left off.
In the special case where the child actually <i>wants</i> to exit permanently,
it sets the <tt>exited</tt> flag in its <tt>filestate</tt> structure
and sets the <tt>status</tt> field in the same structure
to the process's Unix-style exit status:
see our (fairly trivial) implementation
of <tt>exit()</tt> in <tt>lib/stdlib.c</tt>.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 6.</span>
	Study the <tt>file_io()</tt> function in <tt>kern/file.c</tt>
	and make sure you understand how it works.
	Then change your implementation of <tt>proc_ret()</tt>
	in <tt>kern/proc.c</tt>
	to call <tt>file_io()</tt> instead of panicking,
	whenever the root process "returns" explicitly
	via the RET system call.
	(You probably still want a panic
	if the root process returns due to a trap, however.)

	<p>
	Once you do this, <tt>user/testfs</tt>
	should get through the <tt>consoutcheck()</tt> function,
	printing '<tt>consoutcheck done</tt>' at the end &mdash;
	although you won't yet see the console output
	this function is trying to print via the file I/O API.
</p></div>

<h3>Console Output</h3>

Console input and output are essentially independent
and may be implemented in either order,
we will first address console output
since it is simpler and requires no hardware interrupt handling.

<p>
Whenever the root process returns to the PIOS kernel,
the kernel's <tt>file_io()</tt> function
calls <tt>cons_io()</tt> in <tt>kern/console.c</tt>
to see if any console I/O needs to be propagated
between the root process's <tt>consin</tt> and <tt>consout</tt> files
and the "real" console hardware (the screen and keyboard).
If so, <tt>cons_io()</tt> handles this I/O and returns nonzero
indicating some I/O has been performed,
which indicates that <tt>file_io()</tt>
should resume execution of the root process immediately
since the root process may have returned purely to perform this I/O.
If <tt>cons_io()</tt> can find no outstanding "work" to do,
it returns 0.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 7.</span>
	Implement the code in <tt>cons_io()</tt> required
	to detect if the root process has appended any new data
	to its <tt>consout</tt> file since it last synchronized,
	and output that data to the console via <tt>cons_putc()</tt>,
	using proper spinlock synchronization in the kernel
	to ensure that the root process's console writes are atomic
	and will not mingle with concurrent debugging output
	from other processors.

	<p>
	<i>Hint:</i>
	Remember the root process's <tt>consout</tt> file only grows,
	accumulating all data that has <i>ever</i> been sent to the console,
	and doesn't shrink when console output is delivered;
	the kernel just checks for <i>new</i> data appended
	to the <tt>consout</tt> file each time the root process returns.
	Since there is currently no mechanism for "garbage collecting"
	old console output,
	the root process can produce at most 4MB of console output &mdash;
	the size of the <tt>consout</tt> file's data area &mdash;
	before the system will need to be rebooted.
	This is obviously an unfortunate limitation
	that would have to be rectified in a production OS.

	<p>Once this exercise is done,
	<tt>consoutcheck()</tt> should not only complete
	but its output should be correct:
	i.e., you should see three lines of console output
	between the '<tt>should NOT have appeared yet</tt>'
	and '<tt>SHOULD have appeared now</tt>' lines,
	followed by the string '<tt>123456789</tt>' on the next line.
</p></div>

<h3>Console Input</h3>

To add console input support,
we will need to make the PIOS kernel take console interrupts.
In the case of PIOS, the "console" is really an abstract device
that sends output to both the display and serial port,
and receives input from both the keyboard and serial port,
so that our grade scripts can easily interact with your kernel
via QEMU's virtual serial port.
Therefore, the PIOS kernel will need to handle
both keyboard and serial interrupts.
We've provided all the "device driver" code to handle these interrupts
and pull characters from the keyboard and serial devices,
interpreting them as necessary
(e.g., converting scan codes into ASCII characters in the case of the keyboard)
and then placing them into the console input buffer
<tt>cons</tt> in <tt>kern/console.c</tt>.
You just need to make your kernel call <tt>cons_intr()</tt>
whenever the processor receives a keyboard interrupt (<tt>IRQ_KBD</tt>)
or serial interrupt (<tt>IRQ_SERIAL</tt>).

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 8.</span>
	Add trap entrypoints
	for the <tt>IRQ_SERIAL</tt> and <tt>IRQ_KBD</tt> hardware interrupts,
	just like you did for <tt>IRQ_TIMER</tt> in lab 2.
	Modify your <tt>trap()</tt> function to handle these interrupts:
	it should EOI the local APIC
	and call <tt>cons_intr()</tt>
	whenever it receives a keyboard or serial interrupt.
	Make sure <tt>cons_intr()</tt>
	uses your console spinlock correctly
	to serialize access to the console input buffer.
	Finally, uncomment the <tt>cons_intenable()</tt> call
	in <tt>kern/init.c</tt> to allow the serial port and keyboard hardware
	to start producing interrupts.
</p></div>

At this point, the kernel should be prepared to handle console interrupts,
but there is one more problem.
PIOS currently takes interrupts only while running in user mode &mdash;
which was fine when the only external device interrupt it ever needs to take
is the timer interrupt,
to perform a context switch when a user process runs too long
(in which case the user process is obviously running in user mode
where the processor can take the interrupt).
When the system is waiting for console input, however,
it is likely that <i>no</i> user-mode process is running
(because all processes are waiting for input!),
and instead the processor is stuck in <tt>proc_sched()</tt>'s idle loop.
Since this idle loop runs in kernel mode,
interrupts are disabled during the idle loop,
and so the kernel won't receive notifications of console input
even though it has nothing better to do.  Oops.

<p>
There are many solutions to this issue.
One is to design the kernel so that most kernel code is interruptible,
like xv6 is designed.
Another approach is to keep the kernel non-interruptible,
but create a set of dedicated "idle processes,"
one for each physical CPU,
whose purpose is solely to spin in user mode (with interrupts enabled)
whenever a given CPU has nothing better to do.
The JOS kernel takes this approach.
PIOS adopts a somewhat ugly but simple middleground approach:
we retain the convention that interrupts must remain disabled
any time the processor is executing in kernel mode,
<i>except</i> in one specific place: namely the idle loop.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 9.</span>
	Modify <tt>proc_sched()</tt>
	to enable interrupts while within the idle loop,
	and then disable them again before leaving the idle loop.
	Then modify <tt>trap()</tt> as necessary
	to account for the new, slightly modified convention
	that device interrupts can come in either from user mode
	or from the idle looop in the kernel.

	<p>
	<i>Hint:</i>
	Think carefully about what existing code may be affected:
	for example, what should you do (and NOT do)
	if a timer interrupt comes in while in the kernel's idle loop?
	Also, make sure you're not enabling interrupts too early
	or leaving them enabled too long in <tt>proc_sched()</tt>:
	what would happen if interrupts are enabled
	while <tt>proc_sched()</tt> is holding a spinlock, for example?

	<p>
	Once you have completed this exercise,
	verify that you are indeed getting console interrupts
	by adding a <tt>cprintf()</tt> to <tt>cons_intr()</tt>.
	You should be able to see characters appearing in the input buffer
	whenever you press a key in QEMU's display window
	<i>or</i> in the terminal window from which you ran QEMU.
	Be careful about where you put the <tt>cprintf()</tt>, though,
	to avoid recursion on the console's lock.
</p></div>

Now that the kernel can receive input characters from the console devices,
we just need to make it pass them on to the root process
whenever the root process synchronizes by "returning" to the kernel.
As explained above,
the <tt>file_io()</tt> function calls <tt>cons_io()</tt>
whenever the root process returns;
this function should both send new output from the root process to the console
and copy any new input from the console to the root process,
returning 1 if any I/O was accomplished and 0 otherwise.
Notice that if <tt>cons_io()</tt> returns 0,
<tt>file_io()</tt> just puts the root process to sleep,
in order to wait for some future input that is not yet available.
Once woken up,
the root process will simply "return" again
until the input it's waiting for has appeared in its <tt>consin</tt> file.
Therefore, to make console input work correctly,
the <tt>cons_io()</tt> function needs to propagate
console input as well as output,
and an incoming console interrupt needs to awaken the root process
if it's asleep waiting for console I/O.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 10.</span>
	Add console input support to <tt>cons_io()</tt>,
	and make <tt>cons_intr()</tt>
	call the function <tt>file_wakeroot()</tt> we have provided
	to awaken the root process from an I/O-related slumber.
</p></div>

The final missing piece is in user space.
Your implementation of <tt>fileino_read()</tt>
probably assumes that the file it is reading from is "complete",
its total size is accounted for
by the <tt>fileinode</tt>'s <tt>size</tt> field,
and if the caller attempts to read past the end of the file
it should just return a short read.
These assumptions are true of normal files,
but not of the special <tt>consin</tt> file,
because this special file's size reflects only the number of bytes
that have been received from the console <i>so far</i>,
not the total number of bytes that may eventually be received
(which may in theory be infinite).
That is, the <tt>consin</tt> file is not a "complete" file
but a <i>partial</i> file that grows dynamically
whenever more input becomes available from the parent.
Our initial file system setup code in the kernel's <tt>file_initroot()</tt>
reflects this fact in the <tt>consin</tt> file's inode
by setting the <tt>S_IFPART</tt> ("partial") flag in the inode's <tt>mode</tt>.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 11.</span>
	Modify <tt>fileino_read()</tt>
	to check for the <tt>S_IFPART</tt> flag
	whenever the caller tries to read past the end of the file,
	and if it's a partial file such as <tt>consin</tt>,
	just return to the parent via <tt>sys_ret()</tt>
	and then try reading again until the required data is available.

	<p>
	You should now be able to enter characters interactively
	into the <tt>readline()</tt> input loop
	called from <tt>consincheck()</tt> in <tt>user/testfs</tt>.
</p></div>


<h2>Part 3: Fork/Exec and Command-Line Arguments</h2>

Now before attacking inter-process file and I/O reconciliation,
we'll need a brief diversion into process management territory.
The PIOS kernel already provides
all the process management primitives we'll need for now
via its GET/SET system call API;
we would merely like a more high-level, friendly, and familiar way to use them.
To this end, we have provided mostly-complete implementations of Unix-like
<tt>fork()</tt>, <tt>wait()</tt>, <tt>waitpid()</tt>,
and <tt>exec*()</tt> functions
in <tt>lib/fork.c</tt> and <tt>lib/exec.c</tt>.

<h3>Fork</h3>

<p>
The implementation of <tt>fork()</tt> we have provided is complete,
and does pretty much the same thing
as the <tt>fork()</tt> function in <tt>user/testvm</tt> from Lab 3,
except with a bit of bookkeeping logic
to search for and allocate a process ID for the new child process.
Unlike Unix, where process IDs are global,
process IDs in PIOS are local to a given process,
and correspond directly to the child process numbers from 0-255
supported by the PIOS kernel's API.
The Unix-compatible <tt>fork()</tt> function arranges never to use child 0,
since process ID zero is an invalid process ID in Unix
(although it's a reasonable child process number
as far as the PIOS kernel is concerned).
Our implementation of <tt>fork()</tt>
also sets up some state that will be used later in reconciliation
during part 4 of this lab.

<h3>Exec</h3>

<p>
Since you already went through the torture
of implementing the ELF loader the kernel uses to load the root process,
we won't subject you to the further torture
of writing the ELF loader that one process uses to <tt>exec()</tt> another.
But since the kernel doesn't pass any command-line arguments
to the root process,
you missed out on that important part of program loading,
and we'll catch up on that now in this context.

<p>
First study the functions in <tt>lib/exec.c</tt>,
as well as the new assembly language <tt>exec_start()</tt> function
in <tt>lib/entry.S</tt>,
until you understand how the execution process works.
According to the normal semantics of a Unix-like <tt>exec</tt>,
the executed process should <i>replace</i> the process currently executing.
But unlike Unix, which implements <tt>exec</tt> in the kernel
as a system call,
under PIOS we're trying to implement <tt>exec</tt> completely in user space,
<i>within the C library of the process to be replaced</i>.
The key technical challenge is loading the new process
and getting it all set up and ready to go,
<i>without</i> destroying the old process (in which we're still executing)
until the new process is entirely ready
and we're sure we can complete the transition.

<p>
Our user-level <tt>exec</tt> implementation solves this challenge
by setting up the new process's address space in a child process
(child 0 specifically),
and then calling the assembly language function <tt>exec_start()</tt>
in <tt>lib/entry.S</tt>,
which uses the GET system call
to replace the current process's address entire space
with that of the child,
and then start the new executable's <tt>main()</tt> function
running on a "fresh" stack for the new program.
Study <tt>exec_start()</tt>,
and make sure you understand why this transition will only work reliably
if both the new and old programs have <i>exactly</i>
the same <tt>lib/entry.S</tt> code with exactly the same size
and linked at exactly the same location in both programs.

<p>
To set up the new program's address space in child 0,
we'll need to set up the appropriate data in our own address space
and then use the PUT system call to copy it into child 0.
Our <tt>exec_readelf()</tt> function does this for the ELF executable itself,
loading the executable into a 4MB "scratch" address region
from <tt>VM_SCRATCHLO</tt> to <tt>VM_SCRATCHLO+PTSIZE</tt>
and then copying that region into the child's address space.

<p>
Setting up the new program's stack and copying the command-line arguments to it
follows the same pattern.
Since the new program's stack will reside at virtual addresses
that are probably the same as those
currently occupied by <i>our</i> stack in the current program,
and our stack is still very much in use,
we have to set up the new stack at another virtual address
in our address space
and then copy it to the correct location in the address space
of child 0.
The code we've provided again uses the area
from <tt>VM_SCRATCHLO</tt> to <tt>VM_SCRATCHLO+PTSIZE</tt>
for this purpose,
setting up a 4MB stack
to reside from <tt>VM_STACKHI-PTSIZE</tt> to <tt>VM_STACKHI</tt>
in the new program's address space.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 12.</span>
	Modify <tt>exec_copyargs()</tt> in <tt>lib/exec.c</tt>
	to copy the <tt>argv</tt> array, and the strings it points to,
	onto the new stack to be used by the executed program.
	Be very careful with your pointer arithmetic:
	you'll need to create a logical copy of the <tt>argv</tt> array,
	which is an array of pointers (to strings) in the current program,
	into an array of programs
	that the <i>new</i> program will be able to follow
	within its own, <i>new</i> address space.
	This means you'll have to compute the values
	of all pointers you write into the new program's stack
	so that they'll be valid in the stack's <i>final</i> location
	from <tt>VM_STACKHI-PTSIZE</tt> to <tt>VM_STACKHI</tt>,
	rather than at its <i>temporary</i> location
	from <tt>VM_SCRATCHLO</tt> to <tt>VM_SCRATCHLO+PTSIZE</tt>.

	<p>
	The <tt>execcheck()</tt> function in <tt>user/testfs</tt>
	should now be able to fork a child process
	and have that child process execute the simple <tt>echo</tt> program,
	which simply echoes its command-line arguments to the console.
	The <tt>-c</tt> parameter
	that <tt>execcheck()</tt> passes to <tt>echo</tt>
	instructs <tt>echo</tt> to use
	the "debugging console" output function <tt>cnprintf()</tt>
	instead of the general-purpose <tt>printf()</tt> function,
	which will not be fully functional until part 4 of this lab.
</p></div>


<h2>Part 4: File System Reconciliation</h2>

Now that the root process can interact with the "external world"
through the special console I/O files in its file system,
we just need to add the ability for other processes
to interact with the external world &mdash; and each other &mdash;
by reconciling changes to their file systems at synchronization points.

<p>
The problem maintaining consistency among multiple replicas
of a file system or other state repository
is a well-studied topic in distributed systems:
see, for example, <a href="../bib/parker83detection.pdf">
Parker et al.,
<i>Detection of Mutual Inconsistency in Distributed Systems</i></a>.
Since each PIOS process maintains its own copy or "replica"
of a Unix-like file system within the process's own virtual address space,
this collection of PIOS processes is in some ways
more similar to a distributed file system replicated across several machines
than to the standard, single-machine file systems we find in Linux or xv6.
In particular,
for synchronizing and propagating file system changes among processes,
PIOS will use a simplified analog
of the <i>version vector</i> technique presented in the above paper,
so the first thing you should do is read and familiarize yourself
with this paper if you haven't already.

<h3>File Versioning</h3>

When we wish to allow two or more separate entities
(PIOS processes in our case)
to maintain separate replicas of an object such as a file
and be able to read and modify them independently and concurrently,
it is crucial to be able to tell the difference between:

<ol>
<li>	Changes to the file that occured <i>before</i> it was replicated,
	or before the two processes last reconciled their changes.
<li>	Changes that process A made to the file
	<i>after</i> it was replicated or last reconciled,
	independently of process B.
<li>	Changes that process B made to the file
	<i>after</i> it was replicated or last reconciled,
	independently of process A.
</ol>

<p>
Suppose for example that process A creates two files,
<tt>foo</tt> and <tt>bar</tt>,
then forks a child process B,
which inherits copies of both <tt>foo</tt> and <tt>bar</tt>.
Now suppose process A modifies <tt>foo</tt>
(but leaves <tt>bar</tt> untouched),
while process B independently modifies <tt>bar</tt>
(while leaving <tt>foo</tt> untouched).
Finally, process B terminates,
and A synchronizes with B via <tt>waitpid()</tt>.
Besides just collecting B's exit status,
A also needs to obtain whatever changes B made to its copy of the file system:
for example, B might be a compiler
and <tt>bar</tt> may be an ELF executable it produced.
But at the time of the <tt>waitpid()</tt>,
A and B each have files named <tt>foo</tt> and <tt>bar</tt>,
A's <tt>foo</tt> is different from B's <tt>foo</tt>, and
A's <tt>bar</tt> is different from B's <tt>bar</tt>.
A needs to end up with only one copy each of <tt>foo</tt> and <tt>bar</tt>;
but how does A know which is the <i>right</i> one.
The standard answer is to track file <i>versions</i>.

<p>
As part of the <tt>fileino</tt> metadata for each file,
we maintain a <i>version number</i> in the <tt>fileino.ver</tt> member.
A file's version number starts at zero when the file is first created,
and then incremented by 1 each time the file is modified in some way,
such as by writing to the file.
Whenever some process A forks a child B,
the child copies the file's version number at the time of fork
into its <i>reference version number</i> field, <tt>fileino.rver</tt>.
The parent and child then continue running normally,
incrementing the inode's version number field if and when they modify the file.
Later, when the time comes to reconcile A's and B's file systems
(because B terminates, wishes to perform I/O, etc.),
A checks <i>both</i> the parent's and child's "latest" inode version numbers
against the child's reference version number
to see what happened to the file, if anything, since the last reconciliation.
There are essentially four cases:

<ol>
<li>	Neither the parent nor the child modified the file
	since the last reconciliation,
	in which case both the parent's and child's current version numbers
	are equal to the child's reference version number.
<li>	The parent modified the file but the child did not,
	in which case the parent's version number
	is greater than the child's reference version number,
	but the child's current version number is equal to the reference.
<li>	The child modified the file but the parent did not,
	in which case the parent's version number
	is equal to the child's reference version number,
	but the child's current version number is greater than the reference.
<li>	Both the parent and child modified the file,
	in which case both the parent's and the child's
	current version numbers
	are greater than the child's reference version number.
</ol>

<p>
Why do we store the reference version number in the child and not the parent?
Because the parent can synchronize with many children,
whereas the child can synchronize with only one parent:
by storing the reference version number in the child,
we only need one reference version number field.
If we stored the reference version numbers in the parent,
then the parent would need one reference version number for each child,
since different children may have been forked off or last reconciled
at different points in the parent's execution.
In general, when one process can synchronize with many other processes,
a reference version stamp is needed for each <i>synchronizing pair</i>.
This is why for distributed systems replication problem
in which any node can potentially synchronize with any other,
as in the LOCUS system described in the paper referenced above,
each node requires a reference <i>version vector</i>
and not just one reference version number.

<h3>Reconciliation and Conflicts</h3>

When process A is reconciling its file system with child B,
it is fairly clear what it should do in cases 1-3 above,
but case 4 introduces the possibility of a <i>conflict</i>.
To lay out the appropriate actions in each case explicitly:

<ol>
<li>	If neither parent or child modify the file,
	the parent need do nothing on reconciliation.
<li>	If only the parent modified the file,
	then the parent copies its most recent version into the child,
	overwriting the child's older version.
<li>	If only the child modified the file,
	the parent copies the child's new version of the file into itself,
	overwriting the parent's older version.
<li>	If both the parent and child modified the file,
	then a <i>conflict</i> occurs
	and automatic reconciliation may not be possible.
</ol>

The risk of conflicts is a fundamental property
of replicated systems that allow concurrent, independent writes
to the same object:
it is the price of true parallel independence, so to speak.
Fortunately, it is often easy to avoid conflicts in practice,
either manually &mdash;
e.g., by editing a given file only via the machine (or PIOS process)
you know to hold the most recent or "definitive" version &mdash;
or by designing parallel software systems
so that cooperating processes do not attempt to modify
the same file in parallel.

<p>
PIOS leaves it largely to the user or application developer
to avoid conflicting parallel writes to the same file,
and provides only a simple <i>conflict detection</i> mechanism.
Whenever PIOS detects a conflict on a particular file during reconciliation,
instead of actually reconciling the two versions of the file,
it simply sets a special, PIOS-specific flag bit,
<tt>S_IFCONF</tt> ("conflicted"),
in <i>both</i> conflicting versions of the file
(i.e., in both the parent's and child's inode for the file).
When a file is marked conflicted,
<tt>filedesc_open()</tt> will subsequently refuse to open the file,
returning an error instead,
in order to provide an indication of the conflict to the user or application
instead of simply allowing things to proceed using an inconsistent,
potentially corrupt version of the file.
The user can "resolve" the conflict simply by deleting the file,
or by explicitly clearing the <tt>S_IFCONF</tt> bit of the file's mode
(via a <tt>chmod</tt> function that doesn't exist yet
but should be easy to add).

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 13.</span>
	Carefully study the reconciliation code we have provided
	in <tt>waitpid()</tt>, <tt>reconcile()</tt>,
	and the skeleton function <tt>reconcile_inode()</tt>
	and make sure you understand how it works.
	The <tt>reconcile()</tt> function
	is the main "driver" for reconciling two processes:
	it scans through both the parent's and child's inode tables,
	matching up corresponding inodes,
	and when a new inode has appeared in one
	that doesn't yet exist in the other,
	it creates the missing inode to complete the pair.
	It then calls <tt>reconcile_inode()</tt>
	on each matched pair of inodes,
	to compare and reconcile the contents of those inodes.

	<p>
	Complete the implementation of <tt>reconcile_inode</tt>
	according to the reconciliation rules above,
	overwriting the old version of the file with the newer
	when only one process has modified the file since the reference point,
	or marking both files conflicted if both have been modified.
	Once you have this functionality working,
	<tt>reconcilecheck()</tt> in <tt>user/testfs</tt>
	should print '<tt>basic file reconciliation successful</tt>'.
</p></div>

<h3>Append-Only Writes and Automatic Merging</h3>

<p>
Not all concurrent modifications to the same object
always necessarily need to constitute a conflict:
sometimes there is a sensible way
to <i>merge</i> multiple independent modifications to the same object,
so that no true conflict occurs.
For example, if a file contains an address book,
the reconciliation mechanism knows the format of this address book,
and two nodes or processes concurrently modify
different "cards" in the same address book &mdash;
or even different fields in the same card
(e.g., phone number and E-mail address) &mdash;
then it should be possible to merge those changes automatically
without complaining to the user that anything bad happened.
The <a href="../bib/terry95managing.pdf">Bayou</a> storage system
pioneered the development of mechanisms
for automatic reconciliation mechanisms of this variety.

<p>
In PIOS, fortunately,
there is only one relatively straightforward class of concurrent writes
that we care about reconciling automatically:
namely, writes made by processes
when they are attempting to print to standard output.
These standard output writes generally go
either to the special console output file, <tt>consout</tt>,
for display to the user,
or get written in append mode (<tt>O_APPEND</tt>)
to some other text file if the user redirects a program's output.
In either case, the important point
is that these writes are <i>append-only</i>:
they only add to the end of the file and never modify anything already written.

<p>
The traditional Unix semantics for console output or log files
is that multiple processes may concurrently write to the same output file,
and when they do,
all of the processes' writes get intermingled in the output file
in some arbitrary order dependent on the processes' execution times.
If PIOS were to provide 
only the basic file-granularity reconciliation mechanism above,
however,
then in the common situation in which multiple processes
write to the same standard output file,
that standard output file would <i>always</i> become conflicted:
an especially bad result if that common output file
happens to be <tt>consout</tt>.
Therefore, we need to enhance PIOS to handle
this case of concurrent append-only writes more gracefully.

<p>
The solution we adopt is to classify file modifications
into two categories:
<i>inclusive</i> and <i>exclusive</i>.
Append-only writes via file descriptors opened with <tt>O_APPEND</tt>
are inclusive changes;
all other writes, as well as other modifications
such as file truncation or deletion,
are exclusive changes.
Only exclusive changes cause the file's version number to increase:
inclusive, append-only writes cause only the file's <i>length</i> to increase.
Concurrent writes by two processes (e.g., parent and child)
conflict if and only if at least one of those writes is exclusive.
If all writes by both processes are inclusive,
then only the additional <i>file content</i> written by each process
gets merged into the other process's copy of the file.
Merging content in this way requires that we save
not only a <i>reference version number</i>, <tt>fileinfo.rver</tt>,
but also a <i>reference file length</i>, <tt>fileinfo.rlen</tt>,
when forking a child and at each reconciliation point,
so that we know how much of the original file was common
to both parent and child at reconciliation time.

<p>
Suppose for example that process A
appends '<tt>X</tt>' to standard output, then forks process B.
B's reference length (<tt>rlen</tt>) for standard output will be 1,
since standard output contains only the one character '<tt>X</tt>'
at this point.
Process A now appends '<tt>Y</tt>'
while process B concurrently appends '<tt>Z</tt>'
to the same file.
Processes A and B now synchronize and reconcile their changes.
At this point, process A's copy of the standard output file
contains '<tt>XY</tt>',
while process B's copy contains '<tt>XZ</tt>'.
We reconcile these two files
by appending A's writes since the last reconciliation
(i.e., since it forked B) &mdash;
namely '<tt>Y</tt>' &mdash;
to the end of B's file,
and we append B's writes since the last reconciliation &mdash;
namely '<tt>Z</tt>' &mdash;
to the end of A's file.
A's and B's output files are now the same length
and contain the same collection of appends,
although in a different order:
A's output file contains '<tt>XYZ</tt>'
while B's contains '<tt>XZY</tt>'.

<p>
Thus, like Unix, PIOS ensures that all concurrent writes
will eventually get aggregated into a common output file in <i>some</i> order;
but unlike Unix, PIOS doesn't guarantee
that this will be a single, <i>total order</i> 
agreed upon by all processes in the system.
This loss of total ordering
is not a problem for common "output logging" scenarios &mdash;
especially if the child process terminates immediately after reconciling
and hence its version of the reconciled file is never seen by anyone &mdash;
but loss of total ordering could be an issue for some applications
and might require applications to be redesigned to run on PIOS
(or PIOS to be redesigned to provide total ordering).

	Modify <tt>reconcile_inode()</tt>

	Also, ensure that your conflict detection code
	detects and correctly handles the case in which

	and the other process makes an inclusive change (append-only write),

- implement a garbage collection or ring buffering mechanism for console I/O.
- implement symlinks
- implement large files by storing file contents in child processes
- implement proper Unix fd sharing semantics for dup'd descriptors
- keep file inodes and data areas permission-free
