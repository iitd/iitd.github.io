Expected TA workload breakdown ~115 students
8-10 homeworks
  115 * 10 * 20min each = 390 hours
  (20 min is a conservative estimate, this is likely to be more)

4 programming assignments
  each assignment involves: demo, report, TA notes, grading
  expect 1.5 hours per group (or 45 mins per student)
  115 * 4 * 45min = 350 hours

2 minors
  115 * 2 * 1hour = 230 hours

1 major
  115 * 2hours = 230 hours

Total: 1200 hours
Roughly 85 hours per week
or 12 TAs (ideally 14)
