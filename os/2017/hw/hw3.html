<b>Hand-In Procedure</b>
<p>
You are to turn in this homework before the lecture begins. Please
drop your homework in a cardboard box near to the lecture podium. Your
homework must be hand-written (typed homeworks will not be accepted).


<p><h2>Assignment : Paging</h2>
[2 marks]
<p>
On x86 using 4KB pages only, we wish to map virtual address 0x80100000 to
physical address 0x00100000 with read-only permissions. Assume that all segments
are setup to [0:0xffffffff] and use only paging. You will need to describe the
offset at which the page directory
and the page table need to be modified and to what values.

<p><h2>Assignment : Page table reload</h2>
[6 marks]
<p>
Let's look at the page table (kpgdir) that setupkvm produces
<pre>
(gdb) break kvmalloc
(gdb) continue
(gdb) next
(gdb) next  # till execution reaches the start of "switchkvm()" line
(gdb) print/x kpgdir[0]
why is this zero?

let's look up a virtual address
how about the first instruction of kvmalloc
(gdb) x/i kvmalloc
0x80107beb <kvmalloc>:  push   %ebp
how would we translate 0x80107beb to a physical address?

Also, let's look at the current value of the instruction pointer
(gdb) x/i $eip
0x80107bfb <kvmalloc+16>:	call   0x80107c02 <switchkvm>

(gdb) print/x 0x80107beb >> 22
$4 = 0x200
(gdb) print/x kpgdir[0x200]
$6 = 0x114007
Q: what is this?
Q: what is the PPN?
Q: what does the 7 mean?
(gdb) print/x (0x80107beb >> 12) & 0xfff
$6 = 0x107
(gdb) print/x ((int*)0x114000)[0x107]
$12 = 0x107001
Q: what is this?
Q: why 1 in the low bits?
(gdb) print/x 0x107000 + 0xbeb
$13 = 0x107beb
(gdb) x/i 0x107beb

why did the physical address work in gdb?

back to kvmalloc
it called setupkvm to create a page table
now it calls switchkvm to start using it
switchkvm loads kpgdir into %cr3

and now 0x107beb won't work:
(gdb) x/i 0x107beb
0x107beb:       Cannot access memory at address 0x107beb

why?
</pre>
(The exact values of the addresses may be different in your execution, but
the behaviour should be similar).


<p><h2>Assignment : Addressing</h2></p>
[2 marks]
<p>
Suppose you wanted bootmain() to load the kernel at 0x80200000 instead of
0x80100000, and you did so by modifying bootmain() to add 0x100000 to the va/pa of each
ELF section. Something would go wrong. What?

<p><h2>Assignment : Traps</h2>
[4 marks]
<p>
xv6 defines two structures that hold saved registers for a process: struct
trapframe on sheet 06, and struct context on sheet 20. Explain a situation
in which a suspended process will have three sets of saved registers in
its kstack.
<ul>
	<li> Is it possible to have two "context" structures and
one "trapframe" structure on the kstack? If so, when? If
not, why not?
  <li>Is it possible
to have two trapframe structures and one context structure on the kstack.
If so, when? If not, why not?
  <li>Is it possible to have more than three sets of saved registers
	in the kstack? If so, when? If not, why not?
</ul>

<p><h2>Assignment : Context switching</h2>
[6 marks]
<p>
<b>Read</b>: swtch.S and proc.c (focus on the code that switches
between processes, specifically <code>scheduler</code> and <code>sched</code>).
Also process creation: sys_fork() and copyproc().

<p>
In this part of the homework you will investigate how the
kernel switches between
two processes. 

<p>
<b>Assignment</b>:
<p>

Suppose a process that is running in the kernel
calls <code>sched()</code>, which ends up jumping
into <code>scheduler()</code>.

<p>
<b>Turn in</b>: 
Where is the stack that <code>sched()</code> executes on?

<p>
<b>Turn in</b>: 
Where is the stack that <code>scheduler()</code> executes on?

<p>
<b>Turn in:</b>
When <code>sched()</code> calls <code>swtch()</code>,
does that call to <code>swtch()</code> ever return? If so, when?

<p>
Now think back to gcc calling conventions and the invariants
that gcc expects any function, including <code>swtch</code>, to
maintain.  Compare these invariants with what <code>swtch</code>
actually implements, and the state that our kernel maintains in
a <code>struct context</code>.

<p>
<b>Turn in</b>: Could <code>swtch</code> do less work and still be
correct?  Could we reduce the size of a <code>struct context</code>?
Provide concrete examples if yes, or argue for why not.

<p>
Surround the call to <code>swtch()</code> in <code>scheduler()</code> with calls
to <code>cprintf()</code> like this:
<pre>
  cprintf("a");
  swtch(&cpu->scheduler, &proc->context);
  cprintf("b");
</pre>
<p>
Similarly,
surround the call to <code>swtch()</code> in <code>sched()</code> with calls
to <code>cprintf()</code> like this:

<pre>
  cprintf("c");
  swtch(&proc->context, cpu->scheduler);
  cprintf("d");
</pre>
<p>
Rebuild your kernel and boot it on QEMU.
With a few exceptions
you should see a regular four-character pattern repeated over and over.

<p>
<b>Turn in</b>: What is the four-character pattern?

<p>
<b>Turn in</b>: The very first characters are <code>ac</code>. Why does
this happen?
