	<h2>TLBs, Large Pages, Boot sector</h2>
	<h3>TLB</h3>
	<ul>
<li>optimization: CPU's TLB caches vpn => ppn mappings
<li>Typical size: 12-4096 entries
<li>typical hit time: 0.5-1 clock cycle
<li>typical miss penalty: memory access (10-100 clock cycles)
<li>typical miss rate: 0.01-1%
<li>Typically fully associative (to minimize miss rate)
<li>Cache replacement policy: e.g., FIFO, LRU, etc.
<li>It is important for TLB miss rates to be really low (e.g., 0.1-1%) for
paging to be a useful idea. Fortunately, this is true in practice because
programs typically exhibit large temporal and spatial locality.
<li>if you change any part of the page table, you must flush the TLB!
<ul>
    <li>by re-loading %cr3 (flushes everything). e.g., on context switch
    <li>by executing <code>invlpg <i>va</i></code>
</ul>
So, neither write back, nor write through. Requires explicit invalidations and
flushes. Thus OS needs to be careful, e.g., if it overwrites the page table but
does not execute an appropriate <code>invlpg</code> instruction, a user process
may be able to access another process's page.
</ul>

<p>
<h3>Large Pages</h3>
<ul>
	<li>x86 also supports "large pages" of size 4MB. This allows large processes
	to be mapped with less page table space overhead, less translation time, and
	most importantly, less TLB pressure. For example, if a 4MB page can be placed
	contiguously in physical memory, it requires only 1 TLB entry to be mapped. If
	we had used regular 4KB pages, 1024 entries would have been required.
	<li>With large pages, the top 10 bits of the virtual address (VA) are used to index
	into the page directory. The top 10 bits of the PDE are used to identify
	the Physical Page Number (PPN). The last 22 bits of the virtual address are
	used as an offset into the physical page. The last 22 bits of the PDE are
	unused (or used for storing flags), when using large pages.
	<li>Depending on the size of the process and its access patterns in memory, the
	kernel may decide to use large or small pages for it (to optimize performance).
	<li>One immediate use of large pages is to map the kernel's pages. Because the
	kernel typically maps the entire physical memory as one contiguous chunk in
	the VA space, large pages can significantly reduce the number of page table
	entries required to implement this mapping (thus saving physical memory
	space). More importantly, mapping the kernel in this way reduces TLB pressure
	and also improves translation time in case of TLB miss.
</ul>

<p>
<h3>Boot sector</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Only disk state persists across power cycles (off and on). Thus the kernel
	code/data live on disk, so they can be loaded on bootup.
	<li>The disk is divided into <em>sectors</em> (also called <em>blocks</em>) of
	size 512 bytes each.
	<li>Logically, the disk can be thought of as a linear array of sectors, starting
	with sector number <code>0</code>.
	<li>The first sector (number <code>0</code>) is special, and is called the bootsector.
	<li>The hardware (or BIOS) promises to load the bootsector (of 512 bytes) at physical
	addresses <code>0x7c00-0x7e00</code>, and transfers control to address
	<code>0x7c00</code>.
	<li>The OS developer needs to write the contents of the bootsector
	such that it contains the code instructions and the associated
	data to load the kernel from the disk into memory and transfer control
	to it. The code and data to do this, must fit within 512 bytes.
	<li>We will next look at the bootsector code of xv6 for a concrete
	example.
</ul>

<p>
<h3>xv6 Bootsector</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Look at Sheet 84, line 8412 (<code>bootasm.S</code>)
	<ul>
		<li>The first instruction at physical address 0x7c00 is the instruction
		at this line, namely <code>cli</code>.
		<li><code>cli</code> is used to clear the interrupt flag (IF). The
		interrupt flag is a bit in the EFLAGS register which indicates if
		the processor accepts external interrupts or not. If <code>IF=1</code>,
		and an external interrupt occurs (by setting the <code>INTR</code>
		pin in the chip by an external device), the corresponding interrupt
		handler is invoked by transferring control to it through the IDT.
		On the other hand, if <code>IF=0</code>, any external interrupt is
		ignored.
		<li>Before this instruction, the BIOS may have installed some interrupt
		handlers. The kernel now wants to reinitialize everything, and will
		install its own interrupt handlers. However, at this point, it has
		not installed any handlers, so it must disable any external interrupts
		using the <code>cli</code> instruction.
	</ul>
	<li>Look at lines 8415-8418.
	These instructions load zero into all the relevant
	segments, i.e. <code>ds, es, ss</code>. Recall that the processor is
	executing in 16-bit mode at this time, and so segmentation works
	by simply multiplying the segment register by 16 and adding it to the
	offset to obtain a physical address. By zeroing out the segment registers,
	the programmer intends to use a flat address space.
	<li>Ignore lines 8422-8436. This code enables the processor to access
	physical addresses above 2<sup>20</sup>. Recall that the original
	16-bit 8086 processor did not allow physical addresses above
	2<sup>20</sup>, and so this sequence of instructions ensures that this
	is allowed from now on.
	<li>Line 8441: <code>lgdt</code> loads the global descriptor
	table. At this point, the programmer is preparing to switch to 32-bit
	mode with segmentation enabled (also called protected mode). The operand
	of the <code>lgdt</code> instruction is a GDT
	descriptor <code>gdtdesc</code>, [see line 8487] which contains the
	size of the
	GDT (first two bytes) and the base address of the GDT (next four bytes).
	<li>The base address of the GDT (as given in <code>gdtdesc</code>) is
	specified by the <code>gdt</code> variable, which is defined at
	lines 8482-8485. These lines specify the first
	three entries of GDT (the size
	of the GDT is only 3 entries). The contents of these three entries
	are constants that refer to the corresponding : the first entry specifies a
	NULL segment, the second entry specifies a segment that is readable
	and executable and starts at 0 (base) and ends at 0xffffffff (limit),
	and the third entry specifies a segment that is writable and also
	starts at 0 (base) and ends at 0xffffffff (limit).
	<li>Thus, the programmer initializes a flat address space (no
	segmentation), given that it initializes its base to 0 and limit to 2<sup>32</sup>-1.
	(Notice that the macros SEG_NULLASM and SEG_ASM are macros defined elsewhere).
	<li>Also, the programmer will load the first descriptor into CS, and the
	third descriptor into the other segments (DS, ES, SS).
	<li>Ignore the next three instructions (8442-8444). They set the protected-mode
	bit in the control register <code>cr0</code>.
	<li>Finally, the programmer executes <code>ljmp</code> instruction to
	load the CS and EIP registers. Notice that the CS register is loaded
	with <code>SEG_KCODE * 8</code> - this effectively points it to
	descriptor number 1 (SEG_KCODE=1), in privileged mode (the last two
	bits are zero). Also, it loads the EIP with <code>start32</code> which
	is the address of the following instruction.
	<li>The assembly code uses the <code>.code32</code> directive to
	instruct the assembler to assemble all future code for 32-bit mode.
	<li>The first few instructions in 32-bit mode (8458-8461) setup
	DS, ES, and SS registers to point to the second segment
	descriptor in privileged mode (SEG_KDATA * 8).
	<li>Also, FS and GS are made to point to the NULL segment descriptor
	as the programmer is not planning to use these segments at all. (Recall
	that DS, ES, and SS are default segments for some instructions, so they
	definitely need to point to a valid segment).
	<li>Line 8467: Here, the stack is initialized to point to <code>start</code>
	(whose value is 0x7c00, as that's where the execution starts).
	Because the stack grows downwards, the space below 0x7c00 is used
	for the stack frames. The stack is initialized because in the
	next instruction, a function call will be made which will push the
	return address to stack.
	<li>Finally, the assembly makes a function call into the C function,
	<code>bootmain</code>. <code>bootmain</code> also points in
	the bootsector region (0x7c00-0x7e00), just like <code>start</code>
	and <code>start32</code>. <code>bootmain</code> is written in
	C and compiled into binary code before storing it in the bootsector.
	<li>Because the stack has been initialized, all local variables
	of <code>bootmain</code> will be allocated on the stack.
	</ul>
</ul>
