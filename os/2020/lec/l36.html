<h2>ext3 modes</h2>
<p>
disks usually have write caches and re-order writes, for performance
<ul>
	<li>sometimes hard to turn off (the disk lies)
	<li>people often leave re-ordering enabled for speed, out of ignorance
</ul>
bad news if disk writes commit block before preceding stuff
<ul>
	<li>then recovery replays "descriptors" with random block #s!
  and writes them with random content!
	<li>Solution: have a checksum in the commit record. Ext3 does not support this though.
</ul>

<p>
ordered vs journaled
<ul>
	<li>journaling file content is slow, every data block written twice
	<li>perhaps not needed to keep FS internally consistent
	<li>can we just lazily write file content blocks?
	<li>no:
    if metadata updated first, crash may leave dangling pointers from file inodes
	<li>
	ext3 ordered mode:
	<ul>
		<li>write content block to disk before commiting inode w/ new block #
    thus won't see stale data if there's a crash
	</ul>
	<li>most people use ext3 ordered mode
</ul>

<!--
correctness challenges w/ ordered mode:
  A. rmdir, re-use block for file, ordered write of file,
       crash before rmdir or write committed
     now scribbled over the directory block
     fix: defer free of block until freeing operation forced to log on disk
  B. rmdir, commit, re-use block in file, ordered file write, commit,
       crash, replay rmdir
     file is left w/ directory content e.g. . and ..
     fix: revoke records, prevent log replay of a given block

final tidbit
  open a file, then unlink it
  unlink commits
  file is open, so unlink removes dir ent but doesn't free blocks
  crash
  nothing interesting in log to replay
  inode and blocks not on free list, also not reachably by any name
    will never be freed! oops
  solution: add inode to linked list starting from FS superblock
    commit that along with remove of dir ent
  recovery looks at that list, completes deletions

does ext3 fix the xv6 log performance problems?
  only one transaction at a time -- yes
  synchronous write to on-disk log -- yes, but 5-second window
  tiny update -> whole block write -- yes (indirectly)
  synchronous writes to home locations after commit -- yes
-->

<p>
ext3 very successful
<ul>
	<li>but: no checksum -- ext4
	<!--<li>but: not efficient for applications that use fsync() -->
</ul>

<h3>What are the persistence guarantees for the user?</h3>
None, except that her data will be persistent after 30 seconds. But can
use <code>fsync()</code> to ensure that the data has become persistent.
How will fsync() be implemented in ext3? enough to close commit the current
transaction? or do we need to apply the log to the FS tree also?

<p>Databases provide persistence guarantees, and so make extensive
use of fsync() if implemented in userspace. Makes filesystem performance
much worse. Better to expose raw disk to database than layering it on
top of a file system.

<h2>Protection and Security</h2>
Protection involves mechanisms that prevent accidental or intentional
misuse of the system. There are three aspects to a protection mechanism:
<ul>
	<li>Authentication: identify a responsible party (<em>principal</em>) behind
	each action.
	<li>Authorization: determine which principals are allowed to perform which
	actions.
	<li>Access enforcement: Combine authentication and authorization to control
	access.
</ul>
A tiny flaw in any of these areas can compromise the entire protection
mechanism.

<h3>Authentication</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Typically done with passwords:
	<ul>
		<li>A secret piece of information used to establish user identity
		<li>Must not be stored in directly-readable form: one-way transformations
		<li>Passwords should be relatively long and obscure, to prevent brute-force
		attacks.
	</ul>
	<li>Alternate form of authentication: badge or key
	<ul>
		<li>Does not have to be kept secret
		<li>Should not be forgable or copyable
		<li>Can be stolen, but owner will know if it is
		<li>Paradox: key must be cheap to make, hard to duplicate
	</ul>
	<li>Once authentication is complete, the identity of the principal must
	be protected from tampering
	<li>Once you log in, your user ID is associated with every process executed
	under that login: each process inherits user ID of its parent
</ul>

<h3>Authorization</h3>
Goal: determine which principals can perform which operations on which objects
<ul>
	<li>Logically, authorization information represented as an <em>access matrix</em>
	<ul>
		<li>One row per principal
		<li>One column per object
		<li>Each entry indicates what that principal can do to that object
	</ul>
	<li>In practice, a full access matrix would be too bulky, so it gets
	stored in one of two compressed ways: access control lists and capabilities.
	<li><em>Access Control Lists</em> (ACLs): organize by columns.
	<ul>
		<li>With each object, store information about which users are allowed to
		perform which operations
		<li>Most general form: list of (user, privilege) pairs
		<li>For simplicity, users can be organized into groups, with a single ACL
		entry for an entire group
		<li>ACLs can be very general (Windows) or simplified (Unix)
		<li>UNIX: 9 bits per file:
		<ul>
			<li>user/owner, group, others
			<li>read, write, execute for each of the above
			<li>"root" has all permissions for everything
			<li>additional setuid bit to allow any user to execute file with
			owner privileges, i.e., you can execute "os-submit-lab" with your
			instructor's privileges to allow copying of your files to his directory
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li><em>Capabilities</em>: organize by rows.
	<ul>
		<li>With each user, indicate which objects may be accessed, and in what
		ways.
		<li>Store a list of (object, privilege) pairs with each user. This is called
		a capability list.
		<li>Typically, capabilities also act as names for objects: can't even
		name objects not referred to in your capability list.
		<li>As if there was no root directory in UNIX and no "..". Another example
		is file descriptors or page tables
		for processes (here processes are the principals).
	</ul>
	<li>Systems based on ACLs encourage visibility of objects: shared public
	namespace
	<li>Capability systems discourage visibility; namespaces are private by
	default
	<li>Capabilities have been used in experimental systems attempting to be
	very secure. However they have proven to be clumsy to use (painful to share
	things), so they have mostly fallen out of favour for
	managing objects such as files.
</ul>
<h3>Access Enforcement</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Some part of the system must be responsible for enforcing access controls
	and protecting authentication and authorization info
	<li>This portion of the system has total power, so it should be as simple
	and small as possible.
	<li>Examples: OS kernel, tamper-proof code to check cryptographic keys, etc.
</ul>

Common attacks involve <em>Trojan Horses</em>, where a useful
program is
tricked or modified into doing something that it is not supposed to do, but
has the privilege of doing. Example: if there is a bug in the "submit-lab"
script, you can trick it to execute anything with the instructor
privileges.
</ul>
