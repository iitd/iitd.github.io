<!--
Download IOmeter from <a href=http://www.iometer.org>www.iometer.org</a> and estimate the seek time, the rotational delay, and the disk transfer time of your laptop/desktop using varying sizes of workloads. Compare your estimates with the published numbers for your disk (by the manufacturer). Submit a written description of what you tried, and what were your results

<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Download the source tarball (not binary tarballs), and untar it.
	<li>Ensure that you have the following packages installed (on Ubuntu)
	<ul>
		<li><pre>sudo apt-get install libaio1</pre>
		<li><pre>sudo apt-get install libaio-dev</pre>
	</ul>
	If you are performing this experiment on a GCL machine, request updaters@cse
	to install these packages (if not already installed).
	<li>Type <pre>cd src &amp;&amp; make -f Makefile-Linux.x86_64 all</pre>. (If you are on 32-bit system, use  <pre>cd src &amp;&amp; make -f Makefile-Linux.i386 all</pre>
</ul>
