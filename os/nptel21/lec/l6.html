<h2>x86 Physical Memory Map</h2>

<ul>
<li>The physical address space mostly looks like ordinary RAM
<li>Except some low-memory addresses actually refer to other things
<li>Writes to VGA memory appear on the screen
<li>Reset or power-on jumps to ROM at 0x000ffff0 (so must be ROM at top of BIOS)
</ul>

<h2>I/O</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Original PC architecture: use dedicated <i>I/O space</i>
		<ul>
		<li>Works same as memory accesses but set I/O signal
		<li>Only 1024 I/O addresses
		<li>Accessed with special instructions (IN, OUT)
		<li>Example: write a byte to line printer:
<pre>
#define DATA_PORT    0x378
#define STATUS_PORT  0x379
#define   BUSY 0x80
#define CONTROL_PORT 0x37A
#define   STROBE 0x01
void
lpt_putc(int c)
{
  /* wait for printer to consume previous byte */
  while((inb(STATUS_PORT) & BUSY) == 0)
    ;

  /* put the byte on the parallel lines */
  outb(DATA_PORT, c);

  /* tell the printer to look at the data */
  outb(CONTROL_PORT, STROBE);
  outb(CONTROL_PORT, 0);
}
<pre>
		</ul>

	<li>Memory-Mapped I/O
	<ul>
	    <li>Use normal physical memory addresses
		<ul>
		<li>Gets around limited size of I/O address space
		<li>No need for special instructions
		<li>System controller routes to appropriate device
		</ul>
	    <li>Works like ``magic'' memory:
		<ul>
		<li>	<i>Addressed</i> and <i>accessed</i> like memory,
			but ...
		<li>	... does not <i>behave</i> like memory!
		<li>	Reads and writes can have ``side effects''
		<li>	Read results can change due to external events
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Example hardware for address spaces: x86 segments</h2>

<p>The operating system can switch the x86 to protected mode, which
supports virtual and physical addresses, and allows the O/S to set up
address spaces so that user processes can't change them.  Translation
in protected mode is as follows:
	<ul>
	<li>selector:offset (virtual / logical addr) <br>
	     ==SEGMENTATION==> 
	<li>linear address <br>
	     ==PAGING ==>
	<li>physical address
	</ul>

<p>Next lecture covers paging; now we focus on segmentation. 

<p>Protected-mode segmentation works as follows (see handout):
<ul>
<li>segment register holds segment selector
<li>selector: 13 bits of index, local vs global flag, 2-bit RPL
<li>selector indexes into global descriptor table (GDT)
<li>segment descriptor holds 32-bit base, limit, type, protection
<li>la = va + base ; assert(va < limit);
<li>choice of seg register usually implicit in instruction
<ul>
<li>ESP uses SS, EIP uses CS, others (mostly) use DS
<li>some instructions can take far addresses: 
		<ul><li><tt>ljmp $selector, $offset</tt>
		</ul>
</ul>
<li>GDT lives in memory, CPU's GDTR register points to base of GDT
<li>LGDT instruction loads GDTR
<li>you turn on protected mode by setting PE bit in CR0 register

<li>What about protection?
<ul>
  <li>instructions can only r/w/x memory reachable through seg regs
  <li>not before base, not after limit
	<li>can my program change a segment register? yes, but... to one of the
	    permitted (accessible) descriptors in the GDT
  <li>can my program re-load GDTR? no!
  <li>how does h/w know if user or kernel?
  <li>Current privilege level (CPL) is in the low 2 bits of CS
  <li>CPL=0 is privileged O/S, CPL=3 is user
  <li>why can't app modify the descriptors in the GDT? it's in memory...
  <li>what about system calls? how do they transfer to kernel?
  <li>app cannot <b>just</b> lower the CPL
</ul>

</ul>
