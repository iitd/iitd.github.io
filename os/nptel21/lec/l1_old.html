<h1>O/S overview</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<li>	Course goals:
	<ul>
		<li>	Understand OS principles and their low-level design and
		implementation.</li>
		<li> Exposure to non-trivial <i>Systems Programming</i></li>
		<li>	Analyzing xv6, a small Unix-like system
		comparable in structure to a common modern OS.</li>
		<li>	Designing and implementing a small OS
		with a somewhat different structure.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>	Build other skills crucial to effective programming, such as:
		<ul>
			<li>	Clear, precise thinking about how software works</li>
		<li>	Reading, understanding, and building on code
		written by others</li>
		<li>	Collaborative design, development, and debugging</li>
		<li>	Sleuthing skills: finding subtle, non-obvious bugs</li>
	</ul></li>

<li>	Why study operating systems?
	<ul>
		<li>	Aren't Operating Systems commodity. Shouldn't we just treat
		them as black boxes?
		<ul>
			<li> High-performance servers are an OS issue</li>
			<li> Resource consumption (CPU, Power, Memory, Disk) is an OS issue.
			Is my system slow, how to make it faster?</li>
			<li> Security is an OS issue</li>
			<li> Reliability is an OS issue: what causes crashes and how to fix</li>
			<li> Scalability is an OS issue</li>
			<li> Embedded Software is an OS issue</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>	Understand engineering of large event-driven systems in general</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>	OS evolution: step 0 (slide) </li>
<li>	OS evolution: step 1 (slide) </li>
<li>	OS evolution: step 2 (slide) </li>

<li> Protection
<ul>
	<li> Goal: Isolate bad programs and people</li>
	<li> Main Idea: Preemption + Interposition + Privilege Separation </li>
	<li> Preemption: Give app something, can always take it away </li>
	<li> Interposition:
	<ul>
		<li>OS between application and reality</li>
		<li>Track all pieces that app allowed to use (usually in a table)</li>
		<li>On every access, check in the table to check if access is legal</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li> Privileged and Unprivileged mode
	<ul>
		<li> Apps unprivileged (peasant), OS privileged (god) </li>
		<li> Protection operations can only be done in privileged mode. Can it be
	 any other way?	</li>
 </ul></li>

  <li> Successful protection examples </li>
	<ul>
		<li> Protecting CPU: pre-emption
		<ul>
			<li>Clock Interrupt: hardware periodically "suspends" app, invokes OS</li>
			<li>OS decides when to take CPU away (scheduling)</li>
			<li>CPU can also be taken away if (examples)
			<ul>
				<li>Process blocks</li>
				<li>I/O completes</li>
				<li>System calls. e.g.,<pre>
			fd = open("/dev/foo", 1);
			write(fd, "hello\n", 6);
			pid = fork();
			</pre></li>
				</ul>
			</ul></li>
	<li> Protecting Memory: Address translation
	<ul>
		<li> Every load and store checked for legality</li>
		<li> Typically use this machinery to translate to a new value. Why?</li>
		<li> (Protecting Disk memory similar) </li>
</ul></li></ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li>	Translation allows Abstraction + Protection
<ul>
    <li>	<b>Thread:</b> abstract CPU</li>
		<li>	<b>Virtual memory:</b> abstract memory
		<li>	<b>File:</b> abstract disk/tape/flash/etc.
		<li>	<b>Pipe, Socket:</b> abstract communication wire
	</ul>
</li>

<li>	Why is OS design hard (and thus interesting)?
	<ul>
		<li>	Tradeoff between fast/efficient and abstract/modular</li>
		<li>	Want to support many features with a few simple mechanisms</li>
		<li>	Interactions: e.g., <code>fd = open(); ...; fork();</code></li>
		<li>	Many open problems: security, multi-core, distribution</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

</ul>

<h2>Course structure</h2>

<li>Lectures and Homeworks (12% of grade)
	<ul>
	<li>first, basic OS ideas
	<li>then extended inspection of xv6, a traditional O/S
	<li>finally, a series of recent topics
	<li>preparatory homework assignments - see schedule
		<ul>
			<li>	due at beginning of lecture</li>
			<li>	no late homework accepted</li>
		</ul>
	<li>	grade based on homeworks and class participation
	</ul>

	<li>Labs (30% of grade, 10% bonus component): build
	a small 32-bit x86-based OS with
	threads, user processes, virtual memory, and a file system.

	<ul>
		<li>You build it in four labs, final project of your
		choice (bonus marks)</li>
		<li>Kernel interface: only a few simple but powerful abstractions</li>
		<li>Development environment: gcc, qemu, bochs</li>
		<li>Extensive hacking: work in teams of up to 2</li>
		<!--<li>Each lab assignment includes several <i>challenge problems</i>:
		<ul>
			<li>	CSL 373 (btech):
			all challenge problems optional. </li>
			<li>	CSL 633 (mtech, phd):
			must complete at least <i>one</i>
			challenge problem per team per lab.
			Challenge problems of your own choice
			allowed with instructor's permission. </li>
		</ul></li>-->
		<li>Labs due on due date at 11:59PM.</li>
		<li>8 free late days overall, penalized at the rate of 1 mark per day after that</li>
