<h1>Naming in file systems</h1>

Required reading: namei() and associated functions; sysfile.c.

<p>

</p><ul>
    <li>why naming?
	<ul>
	    <li>convenient way for users, applications to keep track
		of their data
	    </li><li>isolates different apps from one another, much like VM
		(e.g. different apps can use different directories)
	    </li><li>can help applications with concurrency and sharing,
		as we will see later
	</li></ul>

    </li><li>conceptual layers (Unix)
	<ul>
	    <li>blocks: 512 bytes on disk. named by a sector number.
	    </li><li>inodes: sequence of bytes, backed by a sequence of blocks.
			inode named by an inode number,
			bytes in an inode named by offset in inode.
	    </li><li>directories: map user-meaningful names to inode numbers.
			directories are inodes, so named by inode number.
	    </li><li>pathnames: describe a way to traverse the directory
			structure to get the desired file.
	    </li><li>(Unix FDs: user-visible binding for an inode;
			more on this later.)
	</li></ul>

    </li><li>pathnames
	<ul>
	    <li>pathnames separated by /, root directory denoted by
		a leading "/"
	    </li><li>special entries "." and ".."
	    </li><li>directory hierarchy -- can create subdirs, etc
	    </li><li>each process has a current working directory (p-&gt;cwd),
		which is used for relative paths (not starting with "/")
	    </li><li>syscalls to manage namespace:
		open, link, unlink, mkdir, chdir
	</li></ul>

    </li><li>limitations, features
	<ul>
	    <li>since naming layer is quite separate from files (inodes),
		can easily have a file with multiple names, or no names
		at all.
	    </li><li>how do we implement rename?  rename-replace?
	    </li><li>hard links for directories?  problem: inode numbers
		don't tell us when we might be forming a cycle..
	    </li><li>fix: disallow hard links for directories
	    </li><li>Unix convention: can only remove empty directories
		(in part making the user do explicit garbage-collection)

	    </li><li>symbolic links: does not hold a reference, but just
		tells the name lookup code to continue looking for
		another name.
	    </li><li>works fine for directories, but does not guarantee
		anything exists.
	    </li><li>tricky bit: relative-path symlinks evaluated starting
		from the directory that holds the symlink, not caller's
		cwd (as if caller provided same relative-path string).
	</li></ul>

    </li><li>how else could you design an FS?  e.g. FAT
	<ul>
	    <li>puts file info (equivalent of inode) in directory entry
	    </li><li>no notion of an inode (file's identity aside from name)
	    </li><li>cannot have hard links to files
	    </li><li>cannot rename across directories
	</li></ul>

    </li><li>NTFS
	<ul>
	    <li>has a notion of an inode
	    </li><li>doesn't have the static disk layout of xv6 fs
	    </li><li>most metadata (like block bitmap) is a file
	    </li><li>kind-of like UVPT trick, can look at inode map as
		just another file
	    </li><li>cute trick: can even map the real boot sector at
		the start of a disk as yet another file
	</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<h2>xv6 data structures</h2>

<ul>
    <li>dirent
	<ul>
	    <li>name: string
	    </li><li>inum: inode number for that file
	    </li><li>empty directory entries: zeroed-out inode
	</li></ul>

    </li><li>dinode
	<ul>
	    <li>nlink: number of links (directory references)
	</li></ul>

    </li><li>inode
	<ul>
	    <li>ref: number of threads that have an in-memory
		pointer to this inode.  FDs, p-&gt;cwd, syscalls,
		namei.
	    </li><li>flags: I_BUSY (locked), I_VALID (data present, like buf)
	    </li><li>we'll see why we need I_BUSY vs ref in a bit..
	</li></ul>

    </li><li>struct file
      <ul>
	<li> abstracts files (files, pipes, ...)
	</li><li> shared offset
	</li></ul>
      </li></ul>

    <li>naming functions:
	<ul>
	    <li>_namei does most name-to-inode translation
	    </li><li>skipelem parses path names
	    </li><li>dirlookup does name-to-inode lookup in a single dir
	    </li><li>dirlink adds names to a directory
	</li></ul>


<h2>xv6 code</h2>

<ul>
    <li>open("a/b/c", O_RDWR)
	<ul>
	    <li>4851: sys_open
	    </li><li>4865: namei should return inode for "a/b/c"
		<ul>
		    <li>4389: namei
		    </li><li>4354: namex
		    </li><li>4361: start in cp-&gt;cwd
		    </li><li>4363: skipelem: a/b/c -&gt; b/c, name=a
		    </li><li>4374: look up "a":
			dirlookup [4212] iterates over all entries in dir
		    </li><li>4379: go back around looking up "b/c" in the "a" dir
		    </li><li>4374: look up "b", ...
		    </li><li>4385: return inode for "a/b/c"
 		</li></ul>
	    </li><li>4874: back in sys_open, get a new FD#
	    </li><li>4883: this is where we save reference to actual inode
	    </li><li>4888: return FD# to user
	</li></ul>

    </li><li>open("a/b/c", O_RDWR | O_CREATE)
	<ul>
	    <li>4851: sys_open
	    </li><li>4801: create
	    </li><li>4807: nameiparent [4396] is slightly different:
		get inode for parent dir, keep name to create
	    </li><li>4811: dirlookup [4212] checks if file already exists.
		who sets canexist?  sys_open, sys_mknod, sys_mkdir.
	    </li><li>4821: get a fresh inode, fill it in
		(ialloc [3952] scans for a type=0 inode)
	    </li><li>4831: add name to directory, dirlink [4252]
		(what if we now crash here?  good example from quiz.
		 how to fix?)
	    </li><li>4838: if mkdir("a/b/c"), create "." and ".." entries.
	    </li><li>what ensures two threads can't race to create same name?
	    </li><li>4846: return newly created inode
	</li></ul>

    </li><li>unlink("a")
	<ul>
	    <li>4751: sys_unlink
	    </li><li>4760: nameiparent again, get parent dir, keep name to unlink
	    </li><li>4765: why do we need to guard "." and ".." here?
	    </li><li>4770: find dirent slot that holds name to unlink
	    </li><li>4774: we already locked directory, why lock inode?
	    </li><li>4778: if removing directory, make sure it's empty
	    </li><li>4784: first blank out dirent
	    </li><li>4789: then drop nlink; what would happen if we did otherwise?
	    </li><li>4791: iunlockput [3924]

	    </li><li>when does the file (inode) actually get freed?
	    </li><li>what happens to files with multiple names (nlink&gt;1)?
	    </li><li>what happens to files still held open by some processes?
	    </li><li>what happens if there's a concurrent link [4663]
		executing for the same inode?
	    </li><li>what happens if there's a process running in a child dir?<br>
		child directory's ".." holds an nlink on parent [4839].
		could have accessed a free directory inode otherwise.
		(and xv6 gets it wrong again; itrunc should
		 drop parent-&gt;nlink..)
	</li></ul>

    </li><li>back to namei: concurrency
	<ul>
	    <li>namei vs unlink of final name
		(what's the precise problem?)
	    </li><li>namei vs unlink/rmdir of directory being traversed
		(what's the precise problem?)
	    </li><li>namei("d1/d2") vs namei("d1/d2/..") -- circular locking?
	    </li><li>key idea: differentiate between locking an inode (I_BUSY)
		vs protecting it from deletion (ref)
	</li></ul>

    </li><li>concurrency requires lots of work to keep data structures
	consistent and to provide some reasonable semantics

    </li><li>work not necessarily wasted:
	lots of applications have potential concurrency
	and crash-recovery issues, and it's convenient when these issues
	can be relegated to some common FS code
	<ul>
	    <li>example: atomic file creation -- create and rename trick
	    </li><li>atomic file replacement?  xv6 lacks rename aka
		unlink-and-link, but most Unix systems do have it.
	</li></ul>

</li></ul>

<h2>symlinks</h2>

<ul>
    <li>what are the interesting points for implementing symlinks in xv6?
</li></ul>
-->
<h2>Access Control</h2>

<ul>
	<li> Access Control Lists
	<li> Capabilities
</ul>
<h2>TOCTTOU</h2>

<ul>
    <li>unfortunately, for all our effort on concurrency,
	some things just aren't solvable in the Unix API.

    </li><li>various system calls take names, but the file it refers to
	can change between each call, making it difficult to know
	what you're really doing

    </li><li>traditionally this problem has come up in privileged code,
	which needs to perform some checks on a file, and if the
	checks succeed, do something to that file.  if the file
	name points to a different inode between the "check" and
	the "do", we have a security problem.

    </li><li>called "time-of-check to time-of-use" (TOCTTOU) bug.

    </li><li>usual example: cleaner for a /tmp directory
	<ul>
	    <li>root runs: <tt>rm /tmp/*/*</tt>
		(really something like
		 <tt>find /tmp <i>-not-accessed-recently</i> | xargs rm</tt>)
	    </li><li>two phases: expand list of files, then unlink them

	    </li><li>attacker: <tt>mkdir /tmp/a; echo &gt;/tmp/a/passwd</tt>
	    </li><li>root's rm: finds /tmp/a/passwd
	    </li><li>attacker: <tt>rm /tmp/a/passwd; rmdir /tmp/a;
		ln -s /etc /tmp/d</tt>
	    </li><li>root's rm: <tt>unlink("/tmp/a/passwd")</tt>,
		unlinks <tt>passwd</tt> from /tmp/a==/etc
	</li></ul>

    </li><li>what's the fix?  expose more inodes (as file descriptors)
	to avoid duplicate namei() calls that might return different
	values.
	<ul>
	    <li>fstat allows us to check file status for an inode,
		rather than path (real unix also has stat, which
		can lead to trouble)
	    </li><li>how to do a directory lookup on a directory inode?
	    </li><li>how to execute a file with a particular inode?
	</li></ul>

</li></ul>

<pre>
 In early versions of Unix there was no mkdir() system call. here's
 the source for /bin/mkdir (from v7 unix):
   if ((mknod(d, 040777, 0)) < 0) {
       fprintf(stderr,"mkdir: cannot make directory %s\n", d);
       ++Errors;
       return;
   }
   chown(d, getuid(), getgid());
 mkdir was setuid to root -- it ran as root even if started by
   an ordinary user, since mknod() is a privileged call.
 what's the problem?
 how to exploit it?
   cd /tmp
   mkdir foo & ./exploit
   exploit waits for foo to appear, then removes it,
     substitutes a link to e.g. /etc/passwd

unix used to be full of such bugs. e.g. mail delivery command
appended to /usr/spool/mail/cs123456, running as root:
 stat(/usr/spool/mail/cs123456)
 if owned by cs123456
   open and write

how do people fix tocttou bugs?
 atomic mkdir() call
 f-calls:
   fd = open(file)
   fstat(fd)
   if(ok)
     fchown(fd)
 don't run as root: structure s/w to drop privileges when possible
   e.g. setuid(cs123456) before delivering mail
</pre>

    <li>will talk about a research paper per lecture
    </li><li>lecture after next lecture: paper on getting both crash-consistency and
	performance in a file system.
    </li><li>read paper before class, lecture will discuss it in detail,
	be prepared.
