<h2>Address translation and sharing using page tables</h2>

<ul>
<li>386 uses 2-level mapping structure
<li>one page directory page, with 1024 page directory entries (PDEs)
<li>up to 1024 page table pages, each with 1024 page table entries (PTEs)

<li>so la has 10 bits of directory index, 10 bits table index, 12 bits offset
<li>%cr3 register holds physical address of current page directory
<li>puzzle: what do PDE read/write and user/supervisor flags mean?


<p>

<li>now, access memory twice more for every memory access: really expensive!
<li>optimization: CPU's TLB caches vpn => ppn mappings
<li>if you change any part of the page table, you must flush the TLB!
<ul>
    <li>by re-loading %cr3 (flushes everything)
    <li>by executing <code>invlpg <i>va</i></code>
</ul>

<p>Is TLB write through? Is it write back? If not, what is it?

<p>

<li>turn on paging by setting CR0_PG bit of %cr0

<p>

<li>Here's how the MMU translates an la to a pa:

   <pre>
   uint
   translate (uint la, bool user, bool write)
   {
     uint pde; 
     pde = read_mem (%CR3 + 4*(la >> 22));
     access (pde, user, write);
     pte = read_mem ( (pde &amp; 0xfffff000) + 4*((la >> 12) &amp; 0x3ff));
     access (pte, user, write);
     return (pte &amp; 0xfffff000) + (la &amp; 0xfff);
   }

   // check protection. pxe is a pte or pde.
   // user is true if CPL==3
   void
   access (uint pxe, bool user, bool write)
   {
     if (!(pxe &amp; PG_P)  
        => page fault -- page not present
     if (!(pxe &amp; PG_U) &amp;&amp; user)
        => page fault -- not access for user
   
     if (write &amp;&amp; !(pxe &amp; PG_W)) {
       if (user)   
          => page fault -- not writable
       if (%CR0 &amp; CR0_WP) 
          => page fault -- not writable
     }
   }
   </pre>

</ul>


<p>Can we use paging to limit what memory an app can read/write?
<ul>
<li>user can't modify cr3 (requires privilege)
<li>is that enough?
<li>could user modify page tables? after all, they are in memory.
</ul>

<p>Who stores what?
<ul>
	<li>cr3: physical address
	<li>GDTR: linear address
	<li>GDT descriptor: linear address
	<li>IDTR: linear address
	<li>IDT descriptor: virtual address
</ul>

<!--
<p>Pintos:
<ul>
	<li>Kernel mapped in top 1GB of every process address space
	<li>Kernel pages have PG_U bit 0
	<li>Dealing with user pointers - three options:
	<ul>
		<li>Convert user pointer to kernel pointer (in kernel's address space) by walking the page table in software. Then dereference kernel pointer
		<li>Check user pointer by walking the page table in software. Then dereference user pointer
		<li>Dereference user pointer at select code locations only (e.g., <code>copy_from_user</code>, <code>copy_to_user</code>). If there is a bad pointer, it will cause a page fault. The page fault handler can check <code>eip</code> to see if it is one of the <code>copy_xx_user</code> functions. If so, the handler can kill the process and cleanup it's state.
		<li>When will two virtual addresses in the same page table point to a common physical address?
		<li>When will two virtual addresses in two different page tables point to a common physical address?
	</ul>
</ul>
-->

<p>Page tables vs. Segmentation
<ul>
	<li>Good: Pages are easy to allocate (keep a list of available pages
	and just allocate the first available).
	<li>Good: Pages are easy to swap as everything
	is same size and pages are usually same size as disk blocks.</li>
	<li>Bad: Page tables can become very large (need one entry for each
	page-sized unit of virtual memory).</li>
</ul>
