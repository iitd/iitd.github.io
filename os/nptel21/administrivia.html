<h3>Academic Integrity Code</h3>
<b>Academic honesty is required in all your work</b>. Verbal discussion of
assignments is fine but looking at someone else's work and then doing your is
not. You must do all written and programming assignments on your own, except
where group work is explicitly authorised. If you have performed your work
after verbal discussions with others, please explicitly
indicate so in your submission. This is important, as otherwise any undue similarity
would be treated with suspicion.

If you use parts of a solution or code from other
sources (such as Internet, other OSes, etc.), you should explicitly mention it in your
submission. <b>Letting your work become available
  or visible to others is also cheating</b>. The first instance of cheating will
straight-away invite a failure in the course.
