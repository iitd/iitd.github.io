<h3>Reviewing Recursion</h3>
<p>Recursive blue shirt
<ul>
<li>We want to count the number of people in the room who are wearing a blue shirt</li>
<li>We can't directly count (there are a lot of people in the room)</li>
<li>But all of you can help</li>
<li>You can ask questions of the person behind you and respond to the questions of the person in front of you</li>
</ul>
<em>How can we solve this recursively?</em>

<p>The first person looks behind them:
<ul>
<li>If there is no one there, the person responds with 1 if he/she is wearing a blue shirt or 0 if he/she is not.</li>
<li>If there is someone behind the person, <em>ask them how many people behind them (including the answerer) are wearing a blue shirt</em> (<b>recursive call</b>)</li>
<li>Once the person receives a response, they add 1 if he/she is wearing a blue shirt, or 0 if he/she is not, and respond to the person in front of them.</li>
<li>Now I (the instructor) needs to ask everyone in the front row --- much simpler!</li>
</ul>

<p>Recursion and cases: Every recursive algorithm involves at least two cases:
<ul>
<li> <b>base case</b>: A simple occurrence that can be answered directly.</li>
<li><b>recursive case</b>: A more complex occurrence of the problem that cannot be directly answered, but can be instead described in terms of smaller occurrences of the same problem</li>
</ul>

<p>Key idea: In a recursive piece of code, you handle a small part of the 
overall task yourself (usually the work involves modifying the results of 
the smaller problems), then make a recursive call to handle the rest.

<p>Ask yourself, "how is ths task <b>self-similar</b>?"
<ul>
<li>"How can I describe this algorithm in terms of a smaller or simpler version of itself?"</li>
</ul>

<p>Recursion Tips
<ul>
<li>Look for <em>self-similarity</em></li>
<li>Find the minimum <em>amount of work</em></li>
<li>Make the problem <em>simpler</em> by doing the least amount of work possible.</li>
<li><em>Trust</em> the recursion</li>
<li>Find a stopping point (<em>base case</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Three rules of recursion
<ul>
<li>Every (valid) input must have a case (either recursive or base)</li>
<li>There <b>must</b> be a base case that makes not recursive calls, i.e., on some input(s), the code should not make any recursive calls</li>
<li>The recursive case must make the problem simpler and make forward progress to the base case. e.g., if the person behind you asks the person in front of him/her, that is not going to make progress</li>
</ul>

<p>Recursive Program structure
<pre>
def recursiveFunc(...):
  if (test for simple case): # base case 
    # Compute the solution without recursion 
  else:  # recursive case
    # 1. Break the problem into  subproblems of the same form 
    # 2. Call  recursiveFunc() on each  self-similar  subproblem
    # 3. Reassamble the results of the subproblems
</pre>

<h3>Recursion with multiple base cases</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fibonacci numbers
<ul>
<li>Leonardo of Pisa (aka Fibonacci) modeled the following challenge
<ul>
<li>Newborn pair of rabbits (one female, one male) are put in a pen</li>
<li>Rabbits mate at age of one month</li>
<li>Rabbits have a one month gestation period</li>
<li>Assume rabbits never die, that female always produces one new pair (one male, one female) every month from its second month on.</li>
<li>How many female rabbits are there at the end of one year?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Show a graphical picture of a pair of rabbits (A), they mate after one month, and generate another pair (B) after two months.  After three months, the original pair produces another pair (C); while pair B mates. After four months, both pairs A and B, produce two pairs (D and E), while C mates.  And so on...

<p>
Let's work out the numbers:
<ul>
<li> After one month (call it 0): 1 female</li>
<li> After second month --- still one female (now pregnant)</li>
<li> After third month --- two females, one pregnant, one not</li>
<li> In general: <code>females(n) = females(n-1)+females(n-2)</code>:
<ul>
<li>Every female alive at month <code>n-2</code> will produce one female
in month <code>n</code>.</li>
<li>These can be added to those alive in month <code>n-1</code> to get total
alive in month <code>n</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Fibonacci
<ul>
<li> Base cases:
<ul>
<li> females(0) = 1</li>
<li> females(1) = 1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Recursive case:
<ul>
<li> females(n) = females(n-1) + females(n-2)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre>
def fib(x):
  """assume x an int &gt;= 0
     returns Fibonacci of x"""
  if x == 0 or x == 1:
    return 1
  else:
    return fib(x-1) + fib(x-2)
</pre>

<h3>Recursion on Non-Numerics</h3>
<ul>
<li> how to check if a string of characters is a palindrome, i.e., reads the
same forwards and backwards
<ul>
<li> "Able was I, ere I saw Elba" --- attributed to Napoleon</li>
<li> "Are we not drawn onward, we few, drawn onward to new era? --- attributed to Anne Michaels</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Solving recursively?
<ul>
<li> First, convert the string to just characters, by stripping out punctuation, and converting upper case to lower case</li>
<li> Then
<ul>
<li> Base case: a string of length 0 or 1 is a palindrome</li>
<li> Recursive case:
<ul>
<li>If first character matches last character, then is a palindrome if middle section is a palindrome</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Example
<ul>
<li> "Able	was	I,	ere	I	saw	Elba"	--&gt; "ablewasiereisawelba"</li>
<li> <code>isPalindrome("ablewasiereisawleba")</code> is same as:
<ul>
<li> <code>"a" == "a"</code> and <code>isPalindrome("blewasiereisawelb")</code>.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<pre>
def isPalindrome(s):
  def toChars(s):
    s = s.lower()
    ans = ''
    for c in s:
      if c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
        ans = ans + c
    return ans

  def isPal(s):
    if len(s) &lt;= 1:
      return True
    else:
      return s[0] == s[-1] and isPal(s[1:-1])

  return isPal(toChars(s))
</pre>
This is an example of a <em>divide and conquer</em> algorithm.
<ul>
<li> Solve a hard problem by breaking it into a set of subproblems such that:
<ul>
<li> subproblems are easier to solve than the original</li>
<li> solutions of the subproblems can be combined to solve the original</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Exercise: Write a function <code>power</code> that accepts integer parameters for a base and exponent and computes <code>base ^ exponent</code>.
<ul>
<li>First write code using for-loop</li>
<li>Now write a <u>recursive</u> version of this function (one that calls itself)</li>
<li>Solve the problem <u>without using any loops</u>.
</ul>

<p>Method:
<ul>
<li>How is the problem self-similar? x^n = x * x^(n-1)</li>
<li>What is the minimum amount of work? multiplication</li>
<li>How can we make the problem simpler by doing the least amount of work?</li>
<li>What is our stopping point (base case)? n = 0. Why not n=1?</li>
</ul>

<pre>
//Assumes exp &gt;= 0
def power(base, exp):
  if exp == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    return base * power(base, exp - 1)
</pre>
Show the execution of power(5, 3);

<p>Can we do better? Notice that x^18 = (x*x)^9; x^9=x*x^8
<pre>
//Assumes exp &gt;= 0
def power(base, exp):
  if exp == 0:
    return 1
  elif exp % 2 == 0:
    return power(base * base, exp/2) #recursive case 1
  elif:
    return base * power(base, exp - 1) #recursive case 2
</pre>
