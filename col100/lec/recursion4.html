<h3>Matrix Multiplication</h3>

<h3>Matrix Exponentiation</h3>
Given matrix <code>X</code>, compute <code>X^n</code>:
<pre>
//Assumes exp &gt;= 0
def power(base, exp):
  if exp == 0:
    return 1
  elif exp % 2 == 0:
    return power(matmul(base, base), exp/2) #recursive case 1
  elif:
    return matmul(base, power(base, exp - 1)) #recursive case 2
</pre>

<h3>Practicing Recursion</h3>

<ul>
<li>Lab 7 Problem 1:
Implement a function num_ways(R, G, B), that takes as input R, G and B,
and returns the number of ways to arrange R identical red balls,
G identical green balls and B identical blue balls in a line such that
no two consecutive balls have the same color.

For example, If R = 1, G = 2, B = 1, the following are the valid ways:

1. RGBG
2. BGRG
3. GBRG
4. GRBG
5. GRGB
6. GBGR

Hence, num_ways(1, 2, 1)  should return 6.
<pre>
def helper(R,G,B,C):
    if R==1 and G==0 and B==0 and C=="R":

        return 1
    if R==0 and G==1 and B==0 and C=="G":

        return 1
    if R==0 and G==0 and B==1 and C=="B":

        return 1
    if C=="R" and R&gt;0:
        return (helper(R-1,G,B,'G')+helper(R-1,G,B,'B'))
    if C=="G" and G&gt;0:
        return (helper(R,G-1,B,'R')+helper(R,G-1,B,'B'))
    if C=="B" and B&gt;0:
        return (helper(R,G,B-1,'G')+helper(R,G,B-1,'R'))
    else:
        return 0

def num_ways(R,G,B):
    return(helper(R,G,B,'R') + helper(R,G,B,'G') + helper(R,G,B,'B'))
</pre>

<li><b>Longest common subsequence</b>:
A longest common subsequence (LCS) is the longest subsequence common to all sequences in two sequences.
It differs from the longest common substring: unlike substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy
consecutive positions within the original sequences. The problem of computing longest common subsequences is
a classic computer science problem, the basis of data comparison programs such as the diff utility,
and has applications in computational linguistics and bioinformatics.
It is also widely used by revision control systems such as Git for
reconciling multiple changes made to a revision-controlled collection of files.

<pre>
LCS("BANANA", "ATANA") = LCS("BANAN", "ATAN")^"A"
LCS("BANAN", "ATAN") = LCS("BANA", "ATA")^"NA"
LCS("BANA", "ATA") = LCS("BAN", "AT")^"ANA"
LCS("BAN", "AT") = ?
</pre>

<p>The LCS problem has an optimal substructure: the problem can be broken down into
smaller, simpler subproblems, which can, in turn, be broken down into simpler subproblems,
and so on, until, finally, the solution becomes trivial. LCS in particular has
overlapping subproblems: the solutions to high-level subproblems often reuse solutions
to lower level subproblems.

<p>Consider two cases:
<ol>
<li> If <code>LCS("BAN", "AT")</code> ends with <code>"T"</code>, then it cannot end with "N", and so <code>LCS("BAN", "AT") = LCS("BA", "AT")</code>.</li>
<li> If <code>LCS("BAN", "AT")</code> does not end with <code>"T"</code>, then <code>LCS("BAN", "AT") = LCS("BAN", "A")</code>.</li>
</ol>
We do not know which case it is, so we try both cases and take the maximum.

<p>Towards a general solution:
<pre>
LCS(X, Y) = "" if X or Y is an empty string
LCS(X."c", Y."c") = LCS(X,Y)."c"
LCS(X."c", Y."d") = max(LCS(X,Y."d"), LCS(X."c", Y))  for c not equal to d
</pre>

<p>Recursive code:
<pre>
def lcs(X, Y):
  if len(X) == 0 or len(Y) == 0:
    return ""
  elif X[-1] == Y[-1]:
    return lcs(X[0:-1], Y[0:-1]) + X[-1]
  else:
    return max(lcs(X[0:-1], Y), lcs(X, Y[0:-1]))
</pre>

</li>
</ul>

<!--
<p>Exercise: write a recursive function convertFromBinary that accepts an a
string of that number's representation in binary (base 2) and
returns the base 10 int equivalent. e.g.,
<pre>
convertFromBinary("111") returns 7
convertFromBinary("1100") returns 12
convertFromBinary("101010") returns 42
</pre>
How is this problem self-similar? What is the smallest amount of work? When to stop?
<pre>
# Returns the given int's binary representation. 
# Precondition: n &gt;= 0 
def convertFromBinary(binary):
  length = len(binary)
  if length == 1:
    # base case: binary is same as base 10         
    return int(binary)
  # recursive case: break number apart 
  lastCharacter = binary[length - 1]
  beginning = binary[0:length - 1]
  return 2 * convertFromBinary(beginning) + convertFromBinary(lastCharacter)
</pre>
