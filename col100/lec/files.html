<h3>Files</h3>

Getting data into programs:
<ul>
<li> Put it directly into the program:
<ul>
<li> Define constants holding your values.
</ul>
</li>
<li> Get it from the user:
<ul>
<li> Keyboard input, Mouse location, etc.  Recall the <code>input()</code> function.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Generate it randomly.  Use Python's <code>random</code> module.</li>
<li> Get it from an external source
<ul>
<li> Store it in a file and read it later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Reading files
<ul>
<li> Virtually all programs that you have used at some point read files from disk:
<ul>
<li> Word processing (documents)</li>
<li> Web browser (cookies)</li>
<li> Games (saved progress)</li>
<li> Music player (songs)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The structure of files
<ul>
<li> A file is just a series of <em>bytes</em> (8 bits, where a bit is either a 0 or 1)</li>
<li> Those bytes can have a structure:
<ul>
<li> <b>Plain-text: bytes represent characters</b>.  We will focus on this.  A Python file <code>a.py</code> is also a plain-text file.</li>
<li> JPEG: bytes encode information about the structure of an image</li>
<li> MP3: bytes encode frequency information about music</li>
<li> Executable: bytes encode code and associated data (e.g., python3 executable)</li>
<li> ...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 1: Open the file.  Step 2: Read the file one line at a time.
<pre>
file = open("mydata.txt")
for line in file:
  print(line)
</pre>
Show an example (perhaps on Python tutor) of a file that has multiple lines and how this program reads the file one line at a time.  Notice that the last character of a line is the "\n" character.

<p>You can use the <code>strip</code> function to remove any leading and trailing whitespace (including newline and tab characters) from the string (to return a new string):
<pre>
file = open("mydata.txt")
for line in file:
  print(line.strip())
</pre>

<p>Does the following code read (and print) a file twice?
<pre>
file = open("mydata.txt")
for line in file:
  print(line)
print("------")
file = open("mydata.txt")
for line in file:
  print(line)
</pre>
No!  Internally, the <code>file</code> object maintains the current position that gets incremented for every line read from it.


<p>Example lab code:
<pre>
def process_input(filename):
    lines = open(filename, 'r').readlines()
    lines = [line.strip() for line in lines]
    ...
</pre>

<p>The <code>readline</code> function is used to read a single line from the file.  The function returns a string that includes the newline character <code>'\n'</code> at its end.  The string is empty only if the <em>end of file</em> (also called <em>EOF</em>) is reached.  The function also increments the
current position in the file, so that a next call to <em>readline</em> returns the next line.
<pre>
file = open("mydata.txt")
line = file.readline()
</pre>

<p>Exercise: write a recursive function <code>reverseLines</code> that accepts a file input stream and prints the lines of that file in reverse order.
<br>Example input:
<pre>
Hello world
Hello foo
Hello bar
baz hello
</pre>
Expected output:
<pre>
baz hello
Hello bar
Hello foo
Hello world
</pre>
Is this problem self-similar? What is a file that is very easy to reverse? Hint: reversing the lines of a file can be done by (1) reading a line L from the file, (2) printing the rest of the lines in reverse order --- self-similarity, (3) printing the line L.
<pre>
def reverseLines(input):
    line = input.readline()
    if len(line) != 0:
        # recursive case
        reverseLines(input)
        print(line.strip())
reverseLines(open("input.txt"))
</pre>
Where is the base-case?

<h3>Directories</h3>
A directory is a cataloging structure which contains
references to other computer files, and possibly other directories.
It is also called a <em>folder</em> on some operating systems.

<p>Need to <code>import os</code> for all directory operations.

<p><code>os.listdir(dir)</code> is used to obtain the names of files (and directories) in
directory <code>dir</code>, as a list of strings.

<p>A file or a directory could be nested in another directory.  The full sequence of directory names to reach a file (including the filename)
separated by a <em>forward-slash /</em> character is called a <em>path</em>. e.g., <code>a/b/c</code>.  If the first character
is a forward-slash, then the path is an <em>absolute path</em> starting from the root directory <code>/</code>; else it is
a relative path from the <em>current working directory</em>.

<p><code>os.path.isfile(path)</code> returns <code>True</code> if and only if the file represented by <code>path</code> is a file.

<p><code>os.path.isdir(path)</code> returns <code>True</code> if and only if the file represented by <code>path</code> is a directory.

<p><code>os.path.basename(path)</code> extracts the filename from <code>path</code> (and ignores all the parent directories leading
up to the filename).

<p>In all cases, <code>path</code> can either be relative or absolute.

<p>Exercise: write a function <code>crawl</code> that accepts a file name as a parameter and prints information about that file.
<ul>
<li>If the name represents a normal file, just print its name</li>
<li>If the name represents a directory, print its name and information about every file/directory inside it, indented.</li>
</ul>
Example:
<pre>
courses
    col100
        lab2
            hello_world.cpp
            order_of_evaluation.cpp
        lab3
            if_then_else.cpp
        minor1.pdf
        minor2.pdf
    phl100
        ...
</pre>

<p>How is this problem self-similar? Crawling a directory can be expressed in terms of crawling the subdirectories, albeit with a different indentation.
<br>Base-case? File
<pre>
import os

# Prints information about this file, 
# and (if it is a directory) any files inside it. 
def crawl(path, indent):
    print(indent + os.path.basename(path))
    if os.path.isdir(path):
        # recursive case; print contained files/dirs 
        for subfile in os.listdir(path):
            crawl(path + "/" + subfile, indent + "    ")

crawl(".", "")
</pre>
