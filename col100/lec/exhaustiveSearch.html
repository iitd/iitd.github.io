<h3>Reviewing Recursion</h3>

<p>Exercise: write a recursive function convertFromBinary that accepts an a
string of that number's representation in binary (base 2) and
returns the base 10 int equivalent. e.g.,
<pre>
convertFromBinary("111") returns 7
convertFromBinary("1100") returns 12
convertFromBinary("101010") returns 42
</pre>
How is this problem self-similar? What is the smallest amount of work? When to stop?
<pre>
# Returns the given int's binary representation. 
# Precondition: n &gt;= 0 
def convertFromBinary(binary):
  length = len(binary)
  if length == 1:
    # base case: binary is same as base 10         
    return int(binary)
  # recursive case: break number apart 
  lastCharacter = binary[length - 1]
  beginning = binary[0:length - 1]
  return 2 * convertFromBinary(beginning) + convertFromBinary(lastCharacter)
</pre>

<p><b>Arm's length recursion</b> or <em>short-circuit recursion</em>.  Consider the following recursive implementation of <code>power()</code>:
<pre>
//Assumes exp &gt;= 0
def power(base, exp):
  if exp == 0:
    return 1
  elif exp % 2 == 0:
    return power(base * base, exp/2) #recursive case 1
  elif:
    return base * power(base, exp - 1) #recursive case 2
</pre>

<p>Here is a short-circuit implementation of the same logic:
<pre>
//Assumes exp &gt;= 0
def power(base, exp):
  if exp == 0:
    return 1
  elif exp % 2 == 0:
    return power(base * base, exp/2) #recursive case 1
  elif:
    return base * power(base * base, (exp - 1)/2) #recursive case 2
</pre>

<p>Similarly, consider the following recursive implementation of <code>fac()</code>:
<pre>
def fac(n):
  if n &lt;= 0:
    return 1
  else:
    return n*fac(n-1)
</pre>
And below is a short-circuit implementation (also called <em>arms-length recursion</em>) of the <code>fac()</code> function:
<pre>
def facHelper(n):
  if n == 2:
    return 2
  else:
    return n*facHelper(n-1)

def fac(n):
  if n &lt;= 1:
    return 1
  else:
    return facHelper(n)
</pre>



<h3>Exhaustive search</h3>
Explore every possible combination from a set of choices or values.
<ul>
<li> often implemented recursively</li>
<li> sometimes called <em>recursive enumeration</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Applications
<ul>
<li> producing all permutations of a set of values</li>
<li> enumerating all possible names, passwords, etc.</li>
<li> combinatorics and logic programming</li>
</ul>

<p>Often the search space consists of many <em>decisions</em>, each of which has several available <em>choices</em>
<ul>
<li> Example: when enumerating all 5-letter strings, each of the 5 letters is a <em>decision</em> and each of those decisions has 26 possible <em>choices</em>.
</ul>

<p>A general pseudo-code algorithm for exhaustive search:
<pre>
Explore(decisions):
  -- if there are no more decisions to make: Stop

  -- else let's handle one decision ourselves, and the rest by recursion.
     For each available choice C for this decision:
     -- Choose C by modifying parameters
     -- Explore the remaining decisions that could follow C.
     -- Un-choose C by returning parameters to original state (if necessary)
</pre>

<p>Exhaustive search model.
<ul>
<li> Choosing
<ol>
<li> We generally iterate over <b>decisions</b>. What are we iterating over here?  The iteration will be done by recursion.</li>
<li> What are the <b>choices</b> for each decision?  Do we need a for loop?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> Exploring
<ol>
<li> How can we <em>represent</em> that choice? How should we <b>modify the parameters</b>?
<ul>
<li> Do we need to use a <b>helper function</b> due to extra parameters?
</ul>
</li>
<li> Un-Choosing
<ol>
<li> How do we <b>un-modify</b> the parameters from the "Exploring" step?  Do we need to explicitly un-modify or are they copied?   Are they un-modified at the same level as they were modified?
</li>
</ol>
<li> Base Case
<ol>
<li> What should we do in the <b>base cases</b> when we are out of decisions?</li>
</ol>
</ul>

<p>Exercise: printAllBinary
<ul>
<li> Write a recursive function <b>printAllBinary</b> that accepts an
integer number of digits and prints all binary numbers that have exactly
that many digits, in ascending order, one per line.

<pre>
printAllBinary(2):
00
01
10
11

printAllBinary(3):
000
001
010
011
100
101
110
111
</pre>

</li>
<li> Choosing
<ol>
<li>We generally iterate over decisions. What are we iterating over here? <em>We are iterating over characters in the binary string</em></li>
<li> What are the choices for each decision?  Do we need a for loop?  <em>Choose 0 or 1</em></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> Exploring
<ol>
<li> How can we represent that choice? Should we modify the parameters and store our previous choices?  <em>Build up a string that will eventually print.  Add the 0 or 1 (choice) to it.  String tracks our previous choices</em>.</li>
<li> Do we need to use a helper due to extra parameters?  Yes</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> Un-Choosing
<ol>
<li> How do we un-modify the parameters from the Exploring step? Do we need to un-modify, or are they copied?  Are they un-modified at the same level as they were modified? <em>If new strings for each call, we don't need to unchoose</em></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> Base Case
<ol>
<li> What should we do in the base case when we are out of decisions? <em>Print the string</em></li>
</ol>
</ul>

<p>Solution:
<pre>
def printAllBinary(numDigits):
  printAllBinaryHelper(numDigits, "")

def printAllBinaryHelper(digits, soFar):
  if digits == 0:
    print soFar
  else:
    printAllBinaryHelper(digits - 1, soFar + "0")
    printAllBinaryHelper(digits - 1, soFar + "1")
</pre>

<p>Show the balanced tree of calls for <code>printAllBinary(2)</code> of depth 3, showing the <code>digits</code> and <code>soFar</code> arguments for each call.  This kind of diagram is called a <em>call tree</em> or <em>decision tree</em>.  Think of each call as a choice or decision made by the algorithm:
<ul>
<li> Should I choose 0 as the next digit?</li>
<li> Should I choose 1 as the next digit?</li>
</ul>


<p>printDecimal: Write a recursive function <em>printDecimal</em> that accepts an integer number of digits and prints all <u>base-10</u> numbers that have exactly that many digits, in ascending order, one per line.
<pre>
printDecimal(2):
00
01
02

<li>We generally iterate over decisions. What are we iterating over here? <em>We are iterating over characters in the binary string</em></li>

<li> Exploring
<ol>
<li> How can we represent that choice? Should we modify the parameters and store our previous choices?  <em>Build up a string that will eventually print.  Add the 0 or 1 (choice) to it.  String tracks our previous choices</em>.</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li> Base Case
<ol>
<li> What should we do in the base case when we are out of decisions? <em>Print the string</em></li>
</ol>
</ul>

<p>Solution:
<pre>
def printDecimal(numDigits):
  printDecimalHelper(numDigits, "")

def printDecimalHelper(digits, soFar):
  if digits == 0:
    print soFar
  else:
    for i in range(10):
      printAllBinaryHelper(digits - 1, soFar + str(i))
</pre>
When the set of digit choices is large, using a loop to enumerate them makes the code succinct (this is okay!).  Notice that we are looping over choices, and recursing over decisions.

<p>All subsets
<ul>
<li>Write a function <b>allSubsets</b> that accepts a list and prints all the subsets of the set represented by a list.  Assume
that the list has only unique elements.
<pre>
allSubsets([]):
[]

allSubsets([1]):
[1]

allSubsets(["a", "hello"]):
[]
["a"]
["hello"]
["a", "hello"]
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Solution:
<pre>
def allSubsets(s):
  allSubsetsHelper(s, [])

def allSubsetsHelper(remaining, curChoices):
  if len(remaining) == 0:
    print curChoices
  else:
    remainingCopy = remaining[:]
    decisionOn = remainingCopy.pop()
    allSubsetsHelper(remainingCopy, curChoices)
    allSubsetsHelper(remainingCopy, [decisionOn] + curChoices)

allSubsets([1,2])
</pre>

<p>Why do we need to clone the list: <code>remainingCopy = remaining[:]</code>.  Consider an implementation where we replace this cloning operation by a simple assignment that creates aliases: <code>remainingCopy = remaining</code>.  Now consider the function activation <code>allSubsetsHelper([1,2], [])</code> which will in turn call <code>allSubsetsHelper([1], [])</code> which will in turn pop the list associated with <code>remainingCopy</code>.  So, the second call from <code>allSubsetsHelper([1,2], [])</code> will now be to <code>allSubsetsHelper([], [2])</code> (instead of the expected <code>allSubsetsHelper([1], [2])</code>. Thus, this program prints <code>[0], [1], [2]</code>, instead of the desired <code>[0], [1], [2], [1,2]</code>.

<p>Instead of copying, we could alternatively, <em>modify</em> and <em>unmodify</em> the input parameter as follows:
<pre>
def allSubsets(s):
  allSubsetsHelper(s, [])

def allSubsetsHelper(remaining, curChoices):
  if len(remaining) == 0:
    print curChoices
  else:
    decisionOn = remaining.pop()  #modify
    allSubsetsHelper(remaining, curChoices)
    allSubsetsHelper(remaining, [decisionOn] + curChoices)
    remaining.append(decisionOn)  #unmodify

allSubsets([1,2])
</pre>
