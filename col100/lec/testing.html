<h3>Defensive Programming</h3>
When we program, we often miss certain important aspects, and introduce
potential errors in the programs, that may manifest only for certain inputs.
For example, it is estimated that even in mature software, it is common to
find at least one bug in every thousand lines of code.
<em>Defensive programming</em> is a term used to describe a collection
of techniques that reduce the chances of errors (also called <em>bugs</em>)
escaping into the program.
<ul>
<li> write <em>specifications</em> for functions</li>
<li> <em>Modularize</em> programs</li>
<li> Check <em>conditions</em> for inputs and outputs (assertions)</li>
</ul>

<p>Two very common methods for defensive programming are:
<ul>
<li> <b>Testing / Validation</b>
<ul>
<li> <em>Compare</em> input/output pairs to specification.  Some common
sentiments during this process:
<ul>
<li> "How can I break my program?"</li>
<li> "It is not working!"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> <b> Debugging</b>
<ul>
<li> <em>Study events</em> leading up to an error:
<ul>
<li> "Why is it not working?"</li>
<li> "How can I fix my program?"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Set yourself up for easy testing and debugging
<ul>
<li> from the <em>start</em>, design code to ease this part</li>
<li> break up the program into <em>modules</em> that can be tested and debugged
individually</li>
<li> <em>document constraints</em> on modules
<ul>
<li> what do you expect the input to be?</li>
<li> what do you expect the output to be?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> <em>document assumptions</em> behind code design. e.g., the input must be a tuple of tuples.</li>
</ul>

<p>When are you ready to test?
