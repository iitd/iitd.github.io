<h4>Review</h4>
Why do we have <code>char</code> type and values when we also have <code>string</code> type and values?  Efficiency (out of scope for this course).

<h4>While loops in Karel and C++</h4>
<pre>
while (condition)
{
  statement;
  statement;
  ..
}
statement;
statement;
  ..
</pre>
Draw flowchart on what happens in what order for the while statement. Show that if and while are very similar, except that while has a back-edge in the flow chart. Highlight that if the condition is false, then the loop body does not execute even once.

<h4>Exercise: Sentinel loops</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>sentinel</b>: a value that signals the end of user input.</li>
<li>sentinel loop: repeats until a sentinel value is seen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: prompt the user for numbers until the user types -1, then output the sum of numbers:
<code>
Enter a number: 10
Enter a number: 20
Enter a number: 30
Enter a number: -1
Sum is: 60
</code>

<p>Program:
<pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include "simpio.h"
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int sum = 0;
  int num = getInteger("Enter a number: ");
  while (num != -1)
  {
    sum += num;
    num = getInteger("Enter a number: ");
  }
  cout << "Sum is " << sum << endl;
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>How is the condition formed? It can be any boolean value which can be formed by a constant (show a while(false) and a while(true) loop) or a variable or an expression. Expressions must be bool-valued and can involve arithmetic, relational and logical operators.

<p>Exercise: write a program that allows you to sum at most 10 numbers at a time.

<h3>For loops in Karel and C++</h3>
<pre>
for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++)
{
  statement;
  statement;
  ...
}
</pre>
Repeats the statements in the body <code>count</code> times.

<p><code>i = 0</code> is the initializer and is run once before the loop starts</p>

<p><code>i &gt; count</code> is the condition that is checked before entering the loop at every repitition/iteration (including the first entry).</p>

<p><code>i++</code> is run each time the code gets to the end of the 'body'</p>

<pre>
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
  cout << "I love COL100" << endl;
}
</pre>
