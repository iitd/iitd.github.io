<h3>Tail recursion</h3>
<b>Tail recursion</b>: when a recursive call is made as the <u>final</u> action of a recursive function.
<ul>
<li>Tail recursion can often be <b>optimized</b> by the compiler. e.g., use <code>g++ -O3 foo.cpp</code>. <code>-O2</code> represents that the compiler should optimize the code with optimization-level 3.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples: Is this tail recursive?
<pre>
def mystery(n):
  if (n < 10):
    return n
  else:
    a = n/10
    b = n %10
    return mystery(a + b)
</pre>
Answer: yes

<p>What about:
<pre>
def fact(n):
  if n <= 1:
    return 1
  else:
    return n * fact(n - 1)
</pre>
Answer: no

<p>Can we rewrite factorial so that it becomes tail-recursive? Tail-recursive factorial:
<pre>
def factorial_helper(n, accum):
  if n <= 1:
    return accum
  else:
    return factorial(n - 1, accum * n)

def factorial(n):
  return factorial_helper(n, 1)
</pre>
Tail recursive solutions often end up passing partial computations as parameters that would otherwise be computed after the recursive call.

<p>Compare with non-recursive factorial (sometimes looking at the non-recursive version of a function can help you find the tail recursive solution):
<pre>
def factorial(n):
  accum = 1
  for i in range(n+1):
    accum = accum * i
  return accum
</pre>
The tail-recursive version often looks like a non-recursive version with a variable or a parameter keeping track of the partial computations. The difference is: the loop is replaced by recursive call.

<p>Another tail-recursion example: <code>fib(n)</code>
<pre>
def fib_helper(n, i, fib_i, fib_prev):
  if i == n:
    return fib_i
  else:
    return fib_helper(n, i + 1, fib_i + fib_prev, fib_i)

def fib(n):
  return fib_helper(n, 1, 1, 0)
</pre>
This implementation is similar to the following non-recursive implementation:
<pre>
def fib(n):
  i = 1
  fib_i = 1
  fib_prev = 0
  while (i != n):
    new_i = i + 1
    new_fib_i = fib_i + fib_prev
    new_fib_prev = fib_i
    fib_i = new_fib_i
    fib_prev = new_fib_prev
    i = new_i
  return fib_i
}
</pre>

<p>Another tail-recursive implementation of <code>fib(n)</code> with fewer arguments to helper function:
<pre>
def fib_helper(n, fib_n, fib_prev):
  if n == 1:
    return fib_n
  else:
    return fib_helper(n - 1, fib_n + fib_prev, fib_n)

def fib(n):
  return fib_helper(n, 1, 0)
</pre>
This implementation is similar to the following non-recursive implementation:
<pre>
def fib(n):
  fib_i = 1
  fib_prev = 0
  while n != 1:
    new_n = n - 1
    new_fib_i = fib_i + fib_prev
    new_fib_prev = fib_i
    fib_i = new_fib_i
    fib_prev = new_fib_prev
    n = new_n
  return fib_i
</pre>

<p>Notice the similarity of tail-recursive implementation to the non-recursive implementation (that uses loops). In general, any loop can be converted to a tail-recursive implementation.  In fact, some programming languages do not support loops and only support recursion --- typically programmers write tail-recursive implementations of their programs in such languages.
