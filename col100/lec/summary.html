<p>Thinking computationally: abstractions, algorithms, automated execution
<ul>
<li> Abstraction
<ul>
<li> Choosing the right abstractions</li>
<li> Operating in multiple layers of abstractions simultaneously</li>
<li> Defining relationships between the abstraction layers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Automation
<ul>
<li> Think in terms of mechanizing our abstractions</li>
<li> Mechanization is possible --- because we have precise and exacting notations and models; and because there is some "machine" that can interpret our notations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Algorithms
<ul>
<li> Language for describing automated processes</li>
<li> And allows abstraction of details</li>
<li> Language for communicating ideas and processes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
