<h2>Recursion</h2>
We will learn a powerful algorithmic technique called <em>recursion</em>
<ul>
<li>Exploit self-similarity in problems</li>
<li>Learn recursive problem solving</li>
</ul>

We will spend several lectures on recursion -- don't worry if it does not make sense today. Your goal should be to do as many examples as possible.

<ul>
<li><b>recursion</b>: The function definition involving a call to the same function
<ul>
<li>Solving a problem using recurstion depends on solving smaller (simpler) occurrences of the same problem until the problem is simple enough that you can solve it directly.</li>
<li>Key question: "<em>How is this problem self-similar?</em>" --- what are the smaller subproblems that make up the bigger problem?
</ul>
</li>
<li>Occurs in many places in code and in real world
<ul>
<li>Looking up a word in dictionary may involve looking up other words (that occur in the meaning of the first word)</li>
<li>Nested structures, e.g., trees, file folders, collections, can be self similar</li>
<li>Patterns can contain smaller versions of the same pattern (fractals) </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>recursive programming</b>: Writing 
<u>functions that call themselves</u> to 
solve problems that are recursive in nature. 
<ul>
<li> An equally powerful substitute for  iteration
 (loops).</li>
<li>Particularly well-suited to solving certain types of problems </li>
<li>Leads to 
elegant
, simplistic, short code (when used well)</li>
<li>Many programming languages (
"functional" languages
 such as 
Scheme, ML, and Haskell) use recursion exclusively  (no loops)</li>
</ul>

<p>Recursive blue shirt
<ul>
<li>We want to count the number of people in the room who are wearing a blue shirt</li>
<li>We can't directly count (there are a lot of people in the room)</li>
<li>But all of you can help</li>
<li>You can ask questions of the person behind you and respond to the questions of the person in front of you</li>
</ul>
<em>How can we solve this recursively?</em>

<p>The first person looks behind them:
<ul>
<li>If there is no one there, the person responds with 1 if he/she is wearing a blue shirt or 0 if he/she is not.</li>
<li>If there is someone behind the person, <em>ask them how many people behind them (including the answerer) are wearing a blue shirt</em> (<b>recursive call</b>)</li>
<li>Once the person receives a response, they add 1 if he/she is wearing a blue shirt, or 0 if he/she is not, and respond to the person in front of them.</li>
<li>Now I (the instructor) needs to ask everyone in the front row --- much simpler!</li>
</ul>

<p>Recursion and cases: Every recursive algorithm involves at least two cases:
<ul>
<li> <b>base case</b>: A simple occurrence that can be answered directly.</li>
<li><b>recursive case</b>: A more complex occurrence of the problem that cannot be directly answered, but can be instead described in terms of smaller occurrences of the same problem</li>
</ul>

<p>Key idea: In a recursive piece of code, you handle a small part of the 
overall task yourself (usually the work involves modifying the results of 
the smaller problems), then make a recursive call to handle the rest.

<p>Ask yourself, "how is ths task <b>self-similar</b>?"
<ul>
<li>"How can I describe this algorithm in terms of a smaller or simpler version of itself?"</li>
</ul>

<p>Recursion Tips
<ul>
<li>Look for <em>self-similarity</em></li>
<li>Find the minimum <em>amount of work</em></li>
<li>Make the problem <em>simpler</em> by doing the least amount of work possible.</li>
<li><em>Trust</em> the recursion</li>
<li>Find a stopping point (<em>base case</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Three rules of recursion
<ul>
<li>Every (valid) input must have a case (either recursive or base)</li>
<li>There <b>must</b> be a base case that makes not recursive calls, i.e., on some input(s), the code should not make any recursive calls</li>
<li>The recursive case must make the problem simpler and make forward progress to the base case. e.g., if the person behind you asks the person in front of him/her, that is not going to make progress</li>
</ul>

<p>Recursive Program structure
<pre>
recursiveFunc ()
{ 
  if (test for simple case) { // base case 
    Compute the solution without recursion 
  } else { // recursive case
    1. Break the problem into  subproblems of the same form 
    2. Call  recursiveFunc() on each  self-similar  subproblem
    3. Reassamble the results of the subproblems
  } 
} 
</pre>

<p>Non-recursive factorial
<pre>
// Returns n!, or 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * ... * n. 
// Assumes n >= 1. 
int factorial(int n) { 
    int total = 1; 
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) { 
        total *= i; 
    } 
    return total; 
} 
</pre>
Important observations:
<pre>
0!= 1! = 1
4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
5! = 5 * (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 5 * 4!
</pre>

<p>Recursive factorial
<pre>
// Returns n!, or 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * ... * n. 
// Assumes n >= 0. 
int factorial(int n) { 
    if (n <= 1) {
        // base case 
        return 1; 
    } else { 
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
        // recursive case 
    } 
} 
</pre>
<ul>
<li>The recursive code handles a small part of the overall task (by multiplying by <code>n</code>), then makes a recursive call to handle the rest
<ul>
<li>The recursive version is written <u>without using any loops</u>
<ul>
<li>Recursion <em>replaces</em> the while loop</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We separate the code into a <em>base case</em> (a simple case that does not make any recursive calls), and a <em>recursive case</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Recursive stack trace: Show the chain of function calls represented through a stack for <code>fact(4)</code>

<p>Consider the following recursive function:
<pre>
int mystery(int n) { 
    if (n < 10) { 
        return n; 
    } else { 
        int a = n / 10; 
        int b = n % 10; 
        return mystery(a + b); 
    }
} 
</pre>
What is the result of <code>mystery(648)</code>? (answer: 9)

<p>isPalindrome exercise: write a recursive function <code>isPalindrome</code> that accepts a string and returns true if it reads the same forwards as backwards.
<pre>
isPalindrome("madam") returns true
isPalindrome("racecar") returns true
isPalindrome("step on no pets") returns true
isPalindrome("able was I ere I saw elba") returns true
isPalindrome("Q") returns true
isPalindrome("Java") returns false
isPalindrome("rotater") returns false
isPalindrome("byebye") returns false
isPalindrome("notion") returns false
</pre>
<ul>
<li>How is this problem <em>self-similar></em>?</li>
<li>What is the minimum amount of work?</li>
<li>How can we make the problem simpler by doing the minimum amount of work?</li>
<li>What is our stopping point, <b>base case</b>?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recursive Big-O</h3>
<ul>
<li>Below is the "pseudocode" for finding BigO of a function
<ul>
<li>Note that this is not real code; this is to show the recursive nature of BigO</li>
<li>Self-similarity: find BigO of smaller code blocks and combine them</li>
<li>The BigO pseudocode does not cover function calls and some other cases (to keep the discussion simple) --- though experiment to expand this</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre>
findBigO(codeSnippet):
  if codeSnippet is a single statement:
    return O(1)
  if codeSnippet is a loop:
    return number_of_times_loop_runs * findBigO(loop_inside)
  for codeBlock in codeSnippet:
    return the_sum_of findBigO(codeBlock)
</pre>
What are the subproblems? loop_inside and codeBlock.
<br>How are the results of subproblems combined? Using "number_of_times_loop_runs" and "the_sum_of"
<br>Where are the recursive calls? calls to findBigO(loop_inside) and findBigO(codeBlock)
<br>What is the base case? single statement
<br>Are we following the 3 rules of recursion? e.g., are we moving towards the base case in the recursive call?

<p>Example: compute bigO for the following code using this recursive pseudocode:
<pre>
for (int i = 0; i < N * N; i += 3) {
  for (int j = 3; j <= 219; j++) {
    cout << "sum: " << i + j << endl;
  }
}
cout << "Enjoy COL100\n";
</pre>
Show the working of findBigO on this code snippet.

<p>Exercise: Write a function <code>power</code> that accepts integer parameters for a base and exponent and computes <code>base ^ exponent</code>.
<ul>
<li>First write code using for-loop</li>
<li>Now write a <u>recursive</u> version of this function (one that calls itself)</li>
<li>Solve the problem <u>without using any loops</u>.
</ul>

<p>Method:
<ul>
<li>How is the problem self-similar? x^n = x * x^(n-1)</li>
<li>What is the minimum amount of work? multiplication</li>
<li>How can we make the problem simpler by doing the least amount of work?</li>
<li>What is our stopping point (base case)? n = 0. Why not n=1?</li>
</ul>

<pre>
//Assumes exp >= 0
int power(int base, int exp)
{
  if (exp == 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return base * power(base, exp - 1);
  }
}
</pre>
Show the execution of power(5, 3);

<p>Can we do better? Notice that x^18 = (x*x)^9; x^9=x*x^8
<pre>
//Assumes exp >= 0
int power(int base, int exp)
{
  if (exp == 0) {
    return 1;
  } else if (exp % 2 == 0) {
    return power(base * base, exp/2); //recursive case 1
  } else {
    return base * power(base, exp - 1); //recursive case 2
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Exercise: write a recursive function convertFromBinary that accepts an a
string of that number's representation in binary (base 2) and
returns the base 10 int equivalent. e.g.,
<pre>
convertFromBinary("111") returns 7
convertFromBinary("1100") returns 12
convertFromBinary("101010") returns 42
</pre>
How is this problem self-similar? What is the smallest amount of work? When to stop?
<pre>
// Returns the given int's binary representation. 
// Precondition: n >= 0 
int convertFromBinary(string binary) {     
    int length = binary.length();     
    if (length == 1) {         
        // base case: binary is same as base 10         
        return stringToInteger(binary); 
    } 
    // recursive case: break number apart 
    string lastCharacter = binary.substr(length - 1); 
    string beginning = binary.substr(0, length - 1); 
    return 2 * convertFromBinary(beginning) + 
               convertFromBinary(lastCharacter); 
} 
</pre>

<p>Exercise: write a recursive function <code>reverseLines</code> that accepts a file input stream and prints the lines of that file in reverse order.
<br>Example input:
<pre>
Hello world
Hello foo
Hello bar
baz hello
</pre>
Expected output:
<pre>
baz hello
Hello bar
Hello foo
Hello world
</pre>
Is this problem self-similar? What is a file that is very easy to reverse? Hint: reversing the lines of a file can be done by (1) reading a line L from the file, (2) printing the rest of the lines in reverse order --- self-similarity, (3) printing the line L.
<pre>
void reverseLines(ifstream& input) { 
    string line; 
    if (getline(input, line)) { 
        // recursive case 
        reverseLines(input); 
        cout << line << endl; 
    } 
} 
</pre>
Where is the base-case?

<p>Exercise: write a function <code>crawl</code> that accepts a file name as a parameter and prints information about that file.
<ul>
<li>If the name represents a normal file, just print its name</li>
<li>If the name represents a directory, print its name and information about every file/directory inside it, indented.</li>
</ul>
Example:
<pre>
courses
    col100
        lab2
            hello_world.cpp
            order_of_evaluation.cpp
        lab3
            if_then_else.cpp
        minor1.pdf
        minor2.pdf
    eel200
        ...
</pre>

<p>Assume following functions are available (using SPL's "filelib.h"):
<table style="width:100%" border="1">
<tr>
<td><code>isDirectory("name")</code></td>
<td>Returns whether the filename represents a directory. Can use <code>stat()</code> method in standard C library but with more complicated syntax and semantics.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>listDirectory("name")</code></td>
<td>returns a Vector&lt;string&gt; with the names of all files contained in the given directory. Can use a combination of <code>opendir/readdir/closedir</code> operations available in standard C library but with more complicated syntax and semantics.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>How is this problem self-similar? Crawling a directory can be expressed in terms of crawling the subdirectories, albeit with a different indentation.
<br>Base-case? File
<pre>
// Prints information about this file, 
// and (if it is a directory) any files inside it. 
void crawl(string filename, string indent) { 
    cout << indent << getTail(filename) << endl; 
    if (isDirectory(filename)) { 
        // recursive case; print contained files/dirs 
        Vector&lt;string&gt; filelist; 
        listDirectory(filename, filelist); 
        for (string subfile : filelist) { 
            crawl(filename + "/" + subfile, 
                  indent + "    "); 
        } 
    } 
} 
</pre>

<!--<p>Exercise: write a function <code>cartesianProduct</code> that takes as input two sets of strings <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and returns a new set that represents the cartesian product of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> with each element formed by concatenating the elements in the two individual sets.
<br>Example:
<pre>
a = {"A", "B"};
b = {"1", "2"};
Output: {"A1", "A2", "B1", B2"} //order is not important
</pre>
<br>How is this problem self-similar?
<ul>
<li>If <code>a = a1 U a2</code>, <code>a X b = (a1 X b) U (a2 X b)</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>a</code> is a singleton set and <code>b = b1 U b2</code>, then <code>a X b = (a X b1) U (a X b2)</code>.</li>
</ul>
Base case(s)?
<ul>
<li>If <code>a</code> is a singleton set and <code>b</code> is a singleton set, then return a singleton set containing the concatenation of the two elements</li>
<li>If <code>a</code> is an empty set or <code>b</code> is an empty set, return the empty set</li>
</ul>
Assume that <code>setUnion(set1, set2)</code> returns the union of <code>set1</code> and <code>set2</code>.
<pre>
Set&lt;string&gt; cartesianProduct(Set&lt;string&gt; a, Set&lt;string&gt; b)
{
  if (a.size() == 0 || b.size() == 0) {
    Set&lt;string&gt; ret;
    return ret;
  }
  if (a.size() == 1 && b.size() == 1) {
    string e1 = a.first();
    string e2 = b.first();
    Set&lt;string&gt; ret;
    ret.insert(e1 + e2);
    return ret;
  }
  if (a.size() > 1) {
    string e1 = a.first();
    Set&lt;string&gt; a1, a2;
    a1.insert(e1);
    a2 = a;
    a2.remove(e1);
    return setUnion(cartesianProduct(a1, b), cartesianProduct(a2, b));
  } else {
    string e1 = b.first();
    Set&lt;string&gt; b1, b2;
    b1.insert(e1);
    b2 = b;
    b2.remove(e1);
    return setUnion(cartesianProduct(a, b1), cartesianProduct(a, b2));
  }
}
</pre>
This does not look like the most efficient solution. Perhaps we can do faster with an iterative solution.  What is the problem with this solution? Multiple output sets will be constructed and copied due to the setUnion operation being called multiple times. Could have done this faster by just writing two nested for-loops. Let's see another example.
-->

<p>Exercise: Write a recursive function <code>fib</code> that accepts an integer <code>N</code> and returns the <code>N</code>th fibonacci number.
<ul>
<li>The first two Fibonacci numbers are defined to be 1.</li>
<li>Every other Fibonacci number is the sum of the two before it.</li>
</ul>
<pre>
fib(1) = 1
fib(2) = 1
fib(3) = 2
fib(4) = 3
fib(5) = 5
fib(6) = 8
fib(7) = 13
fib(8) = 21
fib(9) = 34
...
</pre>
How is this problem self-similar? Computing fib(n) can be done easily if we know fib(n-1) and fib(n-2).
<br>Base cases? n=1,2
<pre>
// Returns the nth Fibonacci number. 
int fib(int n) { 
    if (n <= 2) { 
        return 1; 
    } else { 
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2); 
    } 
} 
</pre>
If you compute <code>fib(6)</code>, how many times is <code>fib(2)</code> called?
<br>If you compute <code>fib(20)</code>, how many times is <code>fib(16)</code> called?
<br>For each call to <code>fib(16)</code>, how many times is <code>fib(12)</code> called</br>
<br>For each call to <code>fib(12)</code>, how many times is <code>fib(8)</code> called</br>
<br>What could we have done better? e.g., the first time <code>fib(16)</code> gets called, we save the value. For each subsequent evaluation of <code>fib(16)</code>, we just return the cached value.

<h3>Memoization</h3>
<b>memoization</b>: caching results of previous expensive function calls for speed so tht they do not need to be re-computed.
<ul>
<li>Often implemented by storing call results in a collection.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pseudo-code template:
<pre>
cache = {}.       // empty 
function f(args): 
    if I have computed f(args) before: 
        Look up f(args) result in cache. 
    else: 
        Actually compute f(args) result. 
        Store result in cache. 
    Return result.
</pre>
We can create a new variable called <code>cache</code> and pass it as a parameter to our <code>fib</code> function as follows:
<pre>
int fib(int n, Map&lt;int, int&gt; &cache) {
    if (n <= 2) { 
        return 1; 
    } else if (cache.containsKey(n)) { 
        return cache[n]; 
    } else { 
        int result = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2); 
        cache[n] = result; 
        return result; 
    } 
} 
</pre>
Is this achieving the desired optimization? Can the cache be pass-by-value?

<p>But how to initialize the cache? Should we tell the user that he needs to initialize and pass the cache --- seems ugly!

<p><b>Wrapper functions</b>
<ul>
<li>Some recursive functions need extra arguments to implement the recursion</li>
<li>A <b>wrapper function</b> is a function that does some initial prep work, then fires off a recursive call with the right arguments.</li>
<li>The recursion is done in the <b>helper</b> function.</li>
</ul>
<pre>
int fibHelper(int n, Map&lt;int, int&gt; &cache) {
    if (n <= 2) { 
        return 1; 
    } else if (cache.containsKey(n)) { 
        return cache[n]; 
    } else { 
        int result = fibHelper(n - 1, cache) + fibHelper(n - 2, cache); 
        cache[n] = result; 
        return result; 
    } 
} 

int fib(int n)
{
  Map&lt;int, int&gt; cache;
  return fibHelper(n, cache);
}
</pre>
Show the evaluation of <code>fib(6)</code> with memoization.

<h3>Tail recursion</h3>
<b>Tail recursion</b>: when a recursive call is made as the <u>final</u> action of a recursive function.
<ul>
<li>Tail recursion can often be <b>optimized</b> by the compiler. e.g., use <code>g++ -O3 foo.cpp</code>. <code>-O2</code> represents that the compiler should optimize the code with optimization-level 3.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples: Is this tail recursive?
<pre>
int mystery(int n)
{
  if (n < 10) {
    return n;
  } else {
    int a = n/10;
    int b = n %10;
    return mystery(a + b);
  }
}
</pre>
Answer: yes

What about:
<pre>
int fact(int n)
{
  if (n <= 1) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * fact(n - 1);
  }
}
</pre>
Answer: no

<p>Can we rewrite factorial so that it becomes tail-recursive? Tail-recursive factorial:
<pre>
int factorial_helper(int n, int accum)
{
  if (n <= 1) {
    return accum;
  } else {
    return factorial(n - 1, accum * n);
  }
}

int factorial(int n)
{
  return factorial_helper(n, 1);
}
</pre>
Tail recursive solutions often end up passing partial computations as parameters that would otherwise be computed after the recursive call.

<p>Compare with non-recursive factorial (sometimes looking at the non-recursive version of a function can help you find the tail recursive solution):
<pre>
int factorial(int n)
{
  int accum = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    accum = accum * i;
  }
  return accum;
}
</pre>
The tail-recursive version often looks like a non-recursive version with a variable or a parameter keeping track of the partial computations. The difference is: the loop is replaced by recursive call.

<p>Another tail-recursion example: <code>fib(n)</code>
<pre>
int fib_helper(int n, int i, int fib_i, int fib_prev)
{
  if (i == n) {
    return fib_i;
  } else {
    return fib_helper(n, i + 1, fib_i + fib_prev, fib_i);
  }
}

int fib(int n)
{
  return fib_helper(n, 1, 1, 0);
}
</pre>
This implementation is similar to the following non-recursive implementation:
<pre>
int fib(int n)
{
  intt i = 1;
  int fib_i = 1;
  int fib_prev = 0;
  while (i != n) {
    int new_i = i + 1;
    int new_fib_i = fib_i + fib_prev;
    int new_fib_prev = fib_i;
    fib_i = new_fib_i;
    fib_prev = new_fib_prev;
    i = new_i;
  }
  return fib_i;
}
</pre>

<p>Another tail-recursive implementation of <code>fib(n)</code> with fewer arguments to helper function:
<pre>
int fib_helper(int n, int fib_n, int fib_prev)
{
  if (n == 1) {
    return fib_n;
  } else {
    return fib_helper(n - 1, fib_n + fib_prev, fib_n);
  }
}

int fib(int n)
{
  return fib_helper(n, 1, 0);
}
</pre>
This implementation is similar to the following non-recursive implementation:
<pre>
int fib(int n)
{
  int fib_i = 1;
  int fib_prev = 0;
  while (n != 1) {
    int new_n = n - 1;
    int new_fib_i = fib_i + fib_prev;
    int new_fib_prev = fib_i;
    fib_i = new_fib_i;
    fib_prev = new_fib_prev;
    n = new_n;
  }
  return fib_i;
}
</pre>

<p>Notice the similarity of tail-recursive implementation to the non-recursive implementation (that uses loops). In general, any loop can be converted to a tail-recursive implementation.  In fact, some programming languages do not support loops and only support recursion --- typically programmers write tail-recursive implementations of their programs in such languages.
