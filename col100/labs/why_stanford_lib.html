<h2>Why are we using Stanford libraries in the course?</h2>

<p><b>Purpose</b>: We have been receiving several questions from the students
and from the TAs on the relevance of using Stanford libraries for teaching
COL100.  This document is intended to dispel some misconceptions and offer
some explanations.

<p>We list some common questions raised:
<ul>
<li><b>Why are we using these libraries in the first place?</b>

<p>This course introduces the students to common programming abstractions
found in modern languages. Some of these abstractions are very difficult
to understand initially but become clear as we go along in the course.
The Stanford libraries are intended to bridge this gap: you can focus
on the intended concepts to be learned and not get entangled in several
syntactic issues that appear in the Standard C++ library.

<p>Example: We have not discussed the concept of an <code>iterator</code>
in the ADTs, e.g., inserting of an element in a vector
can be done using the element index using Stanford libraries; however this requires an iterator in
the Standard C++ library.  There are more such examples.

<p>We do not want to spend too much time in discussing all these intricacies
of C++ STL --- the Stanford library nicely hides these ugly details and lets
us focus on the core concepts of computer science. In many cases, we later
learn about C++ STL (e.g., streams vs. integerToString()) in any case; but
this method of first learning an easier abstraction before being exposed to the
internal details, is perhaps much easier to grasp for most students.
</li>
<li><b>If I already understand C++ STL by reading the online
STL documentation, can I just use STL and avoid Stanford libraries as
much as possible?</b>
<p>Absolutely. The Stanford libraries are just available as a support to you.
If you do not like them, do not use them. It is
largely optional. Some exceptions are where we may explicitly
mention that a certain ADT is available only in the Stanford library (e.g.,
<code>Grid</code>) and so you may be forced to know about it. We do
make it clear before exams in these cases.
</li>
<li><b>Won't Stanford libraries handicap me? I won't be able to use them
in any other context, e.g., programming contests</b>.
<p>This is not true. As far as we know, you are free to include any libraries
in programming contests. That is not to say that we recommend using
Stanford libraries all your life --- as we said earlier, they are only
intended to provide a more gradual learning curve in introductory
CS courses.
</li>
<li><b>But if I learn using Stanford libraries, how am I learning about the
real world?</b>
<p>Almost all Stanford ADTs have a direct counter-part in the C++ STL.
For example, <code>Vector</code> is an easier version of STL <code>vector</code>.
<code>Grid</code> is an easier version of <code>vector&lt;vector&gt;</code>.
Similarly, Queue is an easier version of <a href=http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/queue/queue/>C++ STL <code>queue</code></a>, Stack is an easier
version of <a href=http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stack/stack/>C++ STL <code>stack</code></a>, Set is an easier version of <a href=http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/set/set/>C++ STL <code>set</code></a>, Map is an easier version
of <a href=http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/>C++ STL <code>map</code></a> and so on...

<p>The member functions in the two different ADTs also have almost a direct
one-to-one correspondence with each other. However many things are simplified
in the Stanford ADT. After you learn problem-solving using Stanford ADTs, migrating
to C++ STL ADTs is fairly easy.
</li>
<li><b>Are Stanford libraries superior or advanced in any way to C++ STL?</b>
<p>No! In fact, it is quite likely the Stanford libraries are slower and
less general and more buggy than the C++ STL library. While the Stanford library is perhaps
the work of 1-5 people over 1-2 years, the C++ STL library is the work of thousands of people
over multiple decades.

<p>We are using Stanford library only for their gentle learning slope for
students getting introduced to ADTs for the first time.
</li>
<li><b>Stanford libraries are discussed in lectures, but sometimes programming assignments are based on C++ STL</b>
<p>We try to avoid this, but often cannot --- for example, if one of the Stanford library
ADT is not working correctly (has bugs), we request you to use the corresponding STL ADT. In these cases,
we always try and ensure that we provide the required documentation to map from Stanford
ADT methods to C++ STL methods. As you may have noticed, these mappings are fairly easy
and straight-forward.
</li>
<li><b>Can I use Stanford libraries beyond COL100?</b>
<p>Yes you can, as long as you obey the License agreement provided in the Stanford libraries. Please note that most software development today happens by "standing on the shoulders
of others", i.e., by reusing the work of others. A very common method of reusing other
people's work is to use the libraries written by them. Hopefully, using the Stanford libraries
(and looking inside them at some point) will give you some exposure to this common software engineering
practice.
</li>
<li><b>Some of my questions are still not answered in this document.</b>
<p>Please feel free to write to col100-staff@iitd.ac.in if you still have unanswered questions or concerns.
