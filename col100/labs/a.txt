**Problem Statement 1: Counting Vowels and Consonants in a String**

Your task is to implement the function `count_vowels_consonants(s)` that counts the number of vowels and consonants in the input string `s`. The function should return a tuple `(vowels, consonants)` where `vowels` is the count of vowels in the string and `consonants` is the count of consonants in the string.
