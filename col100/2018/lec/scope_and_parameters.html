<h4>Methods (or functions)</h4>
We can make new commands (or <b>methods</b>). This lets us decompose our program into smaller pieces that are easier to understand.
<pre>
type name()
{
  statement1;
  statement2;
  ...
}
</pre>

<p>Example:
<pre>
int printGreeting()
{
  cout << "Hello, world!" << endl;
  cout << "I hope you had a great day.";
  return 0;
}

int main()
{
  string name = readLine("Next name? ");
  while (name != "")
  {
    printGreeting();
    name = readLine("Next name? ");
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre>
Introduce the <code>void</code> type. Replace return type of <code>printGreeting</code> with <code>void</code>.

<p>Is the following code correct?
<pre>
void printGreeting()
{
  cout << "Hello " << name << endl;
  cout << "I hope you had a great day.";
}

int main()
{
  string name = readLine("Next name? ");
  while (name != "")
  {
    printGreeting();
    name = readLine("Next name? ");
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre>
No. Why? Because name is an undefined variable inside printGreeting.

<p>Another example:
<pre>
void run()
{
  int x = 2;
  printX();
}

void printX()
{
  cout << "X has value " << x << endl; //ERROR: "Undefined variable x"
}
</pre>

<h4>Scope and Parameters</h4>
<pre>
int x = 5;
if (someCondition()) {
  int y = 5;
}
cout << x + y << endl; //Error: Undefined variable y
</pre>
Run through this program assuming that <code>someCondition</code> is true. Show how at closing braces, <code>y</code> becomes history.

<p><em>When a program exits a code block, all variables declared inside that block go away!</em>

<p>The <b>scope</b> of a variable refers to the section of code where a variable can be accessed:
<ul>
<li> Scope starts where the variable is declared.</li>
<li> Scope ends at the termination of the code block in which the variable was declared.</li>
<li>A <b>code block</b> is a chunk of code between <code>{ }</code> braces.</li>
</ul>

<p>Variables have a lifetime (called scope):
<pre>
int main()
{
  double v = 8; //comes to life here ...
  if (condition) {
    v = 4;  //still alive here ...
    ... some code
  }
  ... some other code
} //it goes away here (at the end of its code block)
</pre>
The code block representing the full body of the function is the <b>inner most</b> code block in which it was declared.

Another example:
<pre>
int main()
{
  ... some code
  if (condition) {
    int w = 4;  //w is created here
    ... some code
  } //w goes away here (at the end of its code block)
  ... some other code
}
</pre>
Draw a box around the inner code block to show the <em>scope of <code>w</code></em>.

<p>You <em>cannot</em> have two variables with the same name in the <em>same</em> scope.
<pre>
int main()
{
  ... some code
  if (condition) {
    int w = 4;  //w is created here
    ... some code
    int w = 4; //ERROR!
  } //w goes away here (at the end of its code block)
  ... some other code
}
</pre>
<p>Another example: variables declared in the <code>for</code> construct are assumed to belong to the scope defined by the <code>for</code> loop's body.
<pre>
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++)
{
  int i = 2; //ERROR
  cout << i << endl;
}
</pre>

<p>You <em>can</em> have two variables with the same name in different scopes
<pre>
int main()
{
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { //i ok here
    int w = 2;                  // w ok here
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) { //i ok here
    int w = 3;                  // w ok here
  }
}
</pre>


<p>You <em>can</em> have two variables with the same name in nested scopes (variable shadowing)
<pre>
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  while (...) {
    int i = 5; //ERROR
  }
}
</pre>

<p>You <em>can</em> have two variables with the same name in different scopes
<pre>
void foo()
{
  int w = 3;
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { //i ok here
    int w = 4;                  // w ok here
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) { //i ok here
    int w = 5;                  // w ok here
  }
}
void bar()
{
  int w = 2;
  foo();
  cout << w << endl;
}
</pre>
Show how execution proceeds and how <code>foo</code> scope gets activated when statements in <code>foo</code> are getting executed, 
and how <code>bar</code>'s scope is restored when <code>foo</code> returns from execution.

<h4>Revisiting sentinel loops</h4>
<pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include "simpio.h"
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int sum = 0; //sum must be declared outside
         //of the loop! Otherwise it
         //will be redeclared many
         //times
  int num = getInteger("number? "); //num must
  			    //be declared
  			    //outside of
  			    //the loop!
  			    //Otherwise,
  			    //the loop
  			    //condition
  			    //makes no sense.
  while (num != -1)
  {
    sum += num;
    num = getInteger("number? ");
  }
  cout << "Sum is " << sum << endl;
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>Another example: here, <code>num</code> goes out of scope at the end of each loop iteration. At that point, we have already used its 
value and can discard it.
<pre>
int main() {
  int sum = 0;
  while (true)
  {
    int num = getInteger("Enter a number: ");
    if (num == -1) {
      break; //immediately exits loop
    }
    sum += num;
  }
  cout << "Sum is " << sum << endl;
  return 0;
}
</pre>
