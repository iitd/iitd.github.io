<h3>Using Stanford Libraries without using QT creator</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><h4>Steps to use stanford libraries.</p></h4>

<p>0. Make sure you have cmake installed (If it is not installed and it is your
personal laptop, install using:  <b>sudo apt install cmake</b> . For machines in
CSC or LHC labs, ignore this step)</p>

<p>1. Download <a href="col100-without-qt.zip">col100-without-qt.zip</a> and extract it to place of your choice.</p>

<p>2. Right click and select open in terminal in the folder you have just extracted</p>

<p>3. Run build.sh by typing <b>./build.sh</b> on the terminal. You need to do
this only once on IITD Machines.</p>

<p>4. The stanford libaries will install in a while and successfull installation will print that libraries are installed.</p>

<p><h4>Compilation instructions</h4></p>

<p>0. Write your code as usual using gedit. You can use any libary of stanford
now, i.e. you can do #include "simpio.h" in your code</p>

<p>1. Compile using <b>compile &lt;filename.cpp&gt;</b> instead of g++ &lt;filename.cpp&gt;</p>

<p>2. Run the program as <b>./a.out</b></p>
