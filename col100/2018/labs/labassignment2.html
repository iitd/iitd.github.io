1. Write hello_world program as discussed in class
  <br><br>
2. Write a program to initialize five variables and compute the
following expression and print it on the console.

  <br><br>
double c = 100;
<br>
  double f = 9/5 * c + 32;
<br>
print f using cout
<br>
What is the answer?
<br>
What do you think is the result of the division? Why?
<br>
What is you change 9 to 9.0?  Does the result change? why or why not?
<br>
What is the order of evaluation?  Can you guess the precedence rules
for the order of evaluation?
<br><br>
What is the result if you write the code as the following:
<br>
double c = 100;
  <br>
double d = 9;
  <br>
double f = d/5 * c + 32;
  <br><br>

What about:
  <br>
double c = 100;
  <br>
int d = 9;
  <br>
double f = d/5 * c + 32;
