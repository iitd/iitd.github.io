It was really anazing subject<br>275. good to learn coding <br>276. i liked the teaching style of teacher<br>277. Improves thinking<br>278. Exam preparation can be completed in a day<br>279. Professor Parag Singla was too much dedicated and interactive in the classroom <br>280. Coding<br>281. teacher s communication with us<br>282. I like the way of teaching of prof parag single  <br>283. It focuses on logical thinking<br>284. everything<br>285. It was about something which I never studied before  <br>286. Teaching was good<br>287. It developed an interest in coding and has encouraged me to take up more courses of computer <br>288. Thinking of algorithms is the best thing I like about this course <br>289. In this course i really enjoyed coding   and finding out new solutions for the same question <br>290. Teacher interaction with students<br>291. Logical reasoning and algorithmic thinking<br>292. Learning new things in every lecture topics are somewhat independent <br>293. Very well structured  <br>294. c  <br>295. The level of questions given to us in assignments and exams<br>296. independent thinking was encouraged  and topics were taught in an interesting manner <br>297. introduction to algorithms and more emphasis on problem solving <br>298. Nothing as it was not able to give the complete idea of what this field is<br>299. No opinion<br>300. Coding<br>301. Class was really interactive<br>302. learning new things<br>303. Too easy<br>304. It s just awesome <br>305. Thinking about algorithms<br>306. The basics of coding are taught in this course which is necessary<br>307. Everything<br>308. It s quality and the way it was taught<br>309. Logic applications <br>310. Nice Course in the flourishing area of CS IT<br>311. the interaction with the teacher was the best in this course <br>312. nothing much<br>313. I got used to system<br>314.
 I liked the variation and the variability of thoughts a algorithms  One
 better than other and the continuos process of improvisations in 
solutions<br>315. The teachers were great<br>316. This course is good 
for CS students and the intrested ones  Something new is there in this 
course that might be fine for some students <br>317. Atleast it will be useful once in my life<br>318.
 The professor  Dr  Sourav Bansal  was extremely receptive to questions 
 He made great effort to make sure everyone had understood whatever was 
being taught  He is definitely one of the sweetest professors I ve had 
in the first semester <br>319. programming and coding is addictive<br>320. The topics taught were very interesting and were understood very clearly through the lectures  <br>321. Independent thinking<br>322. The course improved our logical thinking skills <br>323. No comment <br>324. The course was really fun and instructors made sure that class is with them <br>325. independent thinking with very few knowledge xD <br>326. Assignments<br>327. everything<br>328. I got to learn coding for the first time<br>329. The thing I liked the best about this course is that it encourages us to think logically and creatively  <br>330. Systematic execution and great coverage of concepts with great logical discussion<br>331. the logical thinking required to solve the questions<br>332. It is kind of a course which I didn t learn before  This course help us to strengthen our logical thinking  <br>333. It taught us to write programs  which ofcourse is essential in almost every field today <br>334. practical knowledge <br>335. the assignments that could be done easily at our convenience within a week<br>336. The basic understanding of programming languages was made clear <br>337. Enabled logical thinking and reasoning  Also debugging your own solution developed me as a whole <br>338. Some topics i hadn t studied before<br>339. logical thinking abilty<br>340. interaction of teachers with students<br>341. Nothing<br>342. Got a basic idea about programming <br>343. interaction of teacher with student <br>344. COURSE CONTENT<br>345. Thinking<br>346. This gives us exposure to the coding world  that s the best thing of the course <br>347. Technical<br>348. I like the way the teacher taught it logically it inspired me to study the subject more  <br>349. Nothing<br>350. It is a new subject  different from ones taught in school  and an interesting one <br>351. Course itself<br>352. everything<br>353. libert to think as per our thought <br>354. Teacher<br>355. learned the basic coding required <br>356. helps to think logically <br>357. Logical thinking<br>358. No opinion<br>359. We were not supposed to memorise things but only think logically  <br>360. Best among the rest 5<br>361. Nothing<br>362. Coding<br>363. Nothing<br>364. It builds our logical thinking <br>365. Logical thinking<br>366. It was completely new thing for me i liked the analytical thinking approach <br>367. Learning c  <br>368. no opinion<br>369. no comments<br>370. Nothing <br>371. teacher was clearing individual doubts<br>372. no<br>373. Nothing<br>374. Nothing<br>375. no<br>376. N<br>377. nothing<br>378. nothing<br> <br><br>

<strong>Q. No. 2 : What did you dislike the most about this course?</strong> (Responses: 372)<br><br>1. nothing<br>2. basic syntax was not taught clearly so it was difficult to catch initially what is going on<br>3. No Opinion <br>4. Nothing<br>5. Na<br>6. No comments <br>7. everything well <br>8. no comment<br>9. A little heavy<br>10. Nothing<br>11. Nothing<br>12. nil<br>13. mllk<br>14. too hard content for this level of course<br>15. nothing<br>16. nothing<br>17.
 Not much practice was given  Graded assignments had 3 questions which 
could be done for the whole week but in exams we had 4 or 8 questions 
that we had to do in 1 or 2 hrs  practice was not given according to 
paper<br>18. The graded assignments required too much time and effort  <br>19. Nothing<br>20. Stanford library was taught in class which I consider is useless <br>21. This course is really very tough for students who did not have computers as a subject before  I struggled a lot <br>22. The class very rarely but sometimes became monotonous  <br>23. Short time span to learn the course <br>24. Course<br>25. I was not able to understand much<br>26. Sometimes the assignments are quite difficult and lengthy and requires the whole day for its completion <br>27.
 Some students were so damn brilliant   in the beginning i was so tensed
   because i was not even able to understand what was going on and why 
tho  <br>28. Hard graded assignments<br>29. The Prof  used to overwrite on the slides  <br>30. No<br>31.
 The questions asked were too complex and we did not get nearly enough 
practice of algorithms  giving unfair advantage to students who have 
done it in the past <br>32. Work load is quite heavy<br>33. Classes were easy but assignments were hard <br>34.
 The time availability was less during the semester so the students who 
have never studied COL before like me  faced problems in assignment  <br>35. The test papers were much harder than expected<br>36. Nothing<br>37.
 The biggest problem was the assignments which were given in this course
  we were allowed to write the code in our hostel i e  outside the lab 
which wasn t good at all since the code sharing could be done easily  <br>38. Course load is too Heavy and is done very fast in class<br>39. some of the graded assignments were too difficult <br>40. as all the things was fine but there should be more help from the staff in encouraging us to do new assignments by us  <br>41.
 please use computer to teach this course   like make real time programs
 during lecture hours and help us identify probable mistakes and codes  
that  would be much better <br>42. file I O because i confused many times<br>43. Nothing<br>44. nothing<br>45. nothing<br>46. work Load Graded assignments occupied most of our weekdays<br>47. The things done in class are very different and very basic as compared to the lab assignments exams<br>48. Course was too lengthy and hard to understand the concepts <br>49. Nothing <br>50.
 This course is good but those students who had not done like this 
course they face trouble to understand this course  Only on the basis of
 theory we can not understand this course properly <br>51. sometimes 
when my code show some error then i hate this  subject so in my opinion 
some extra help must be provided  less example are taken by instructor 
in class<br>52. Time for assignments<br>53. Lot of hard work is required to be expert<br>54. The most disliked think for me to related this course is it s marking system of exams and lengthy and hard questions <br>55. Nothing as such<br>56.
 The course can be very easy for the people who have learned a language 
in 9th or 10th class and it is very tough for the students who are 
learning it here the first time <br>57. None<br>58. Almost everything 
except Parag Sir obviously   The way it was taught in the classroom  I 
didnt feel concepts were given adequate time in the class Things taught 
were difficult to grasp and I dont think thats the right way c   ought 
to be taught  <br>59. Heavy workload<br>60. I am a civil engineering student so I don t understand the need of this course <br>61. Deviation from the main topic quite often in the lectures earlier on<br>62. In starting students face a quite difficulty<br>63. Sometimes it seemed course was being taurht rapidly<br>64. Not covering all the topics in graded assignment<br>65. Lack of Time and Unfair Distribution of students <br>66. Not able to understand <br>67. Nothing<br>68. Everything i don t like coding <br>69. Tough Questions <br>70. daily assg <br>71. Big O <br>72. Lengthy ordinary codes<br>73.
 The examples that were taught in the class should have been more 
difficult and vast as it caused a lot problem while solving the graded 
assignment  <br>74. the lecture becomes monotonous after some time and 
the complication related to the use of SPL in class and practice but the
 use STL in graded assignments<br>75. nothing<br>76. No comments<br>77. Everything<br>78. Not anything <br>79.
 No one cares about the difference created between the students who have
 no coding background and the ones who knew coding before  <br>80. Burden <br>81. Nothing<br>82. syllabus too long<br>83. Work load was too heavy <br>84. Nothing<br>85.
 assignments  because it should tell in the beginning of the course that
 laptop and regular is extremely important  other u would lag far behind
 your other classmates <br>86. It was very tough for me <br>87. The 
course moved at a very fast pace which created a problems for beginners 
like us and lead to lose confidence and interest in this course which 
leaded to our downfall further It was quite unfair as most students 
already knew many things about coding <br>88. Nothing I like the course  <br>89. The fact that people who had previous coding background had an edge over others<br>90. Very tough for new computer users<br>91. Very tough graded assignments  <br>92. Nothing much  sometimes the pace is too slow <br>93. Too much syllabus<br>94.
 The graded assignments which have became very lengthy by the end of 
semester and they the same time they were also very tough for students 
like me who don t have any background learning of coding <br>95. the teacher doesn t encourage independent thinking<br>96. to much hard stuff given straight way<br>97. Graded assignments were too difficult <br>98. the assignments kept us occupied throughout the week <br>99. Use of stanford library<br>100. teachers behave like the studnt already know much much about subject<br>101. More questions should be discussed in the class <br>102. Graded assignment were too difficult  <br>103. This course is too tough which eventually results in dying interest in the course<br>104. You can only perform good in the exam if you have done the problem set or have learnt certain algorithms <br>105. Nothing<br>106. Not scoring for me<br>107. Workload of assignments and their deadlines <br>108. THE REGULAR GRADED ASSIGNMENT<br>109. everything<br>110. in starting we need to put hard work to get in flow <br>111. The quantity of the assignments <br>112. The way question paper are made <br>113. Some of TA s of this course didn t help much <br>114. Nothing <br>115. Content could have been improved <br>116. Everything<br>117. Debugging is tiresome<br>118. Too much thinking required sometimes  <br>119.
 Everything from teacher to its content taught in lectures and labs Only
 the student who have access to coding earlier got benefit in getting 
marks and I have not got positive intent from this course<br>120. But TA s were not good they not tell the debuggeing of code<br>121. My GAs arent graded  please grade my GAs<br>122. None<br>123. The level increased suddenly <br>124. Nothing<br>125. The assignments were okay but during holidays they were painful<br>126. The teachers write the code  instead they should type it on any platform <br>127. Nothing<br>128. Stanford library<br>129. How it ruined computer science for me<br>130. the word load is too much <br>131. None<br>132. Making ungraded assignments as partial And giving big codes which is difficult at the stage of learning  <br>133. System of graded assignments<br>134. less homework<br>135. If you don t understand the things at right time you lag at every upcoming thing and learning <br>136. Long graded assignments<br>137. too much thinking<br>138. Lesser number of data structures taught<br>139. nothing<br>140. ungraded assignments were also said to be graded but i didn t understand how would they grade it so felt a bit unclear<br>141.
 Actually the assignments are sometimes a load as there are other 
courses too  which present some difficults assignments sometimes and its
 difficult to handle all at the same time<br>142. I have already learnt most of the topics taught in the class before  So i did not feel it much useful <br>143. Actually we couldnt learn much frm the course  I was expecting to learn something higher <br>144. The course is very less it looks like the course can be easily made 1 5 times of now without any problem to students <br>145. Hectic assignments <br>146. Not covering OOPS part of C  <br>147. Nothing<br>148. Nothing <br>149. Nothing<br>150.
 less material and questions for practice  there was literally no 
practice sheets for homework  assignment are not adequate for this task<br>151. Too much pace <br>152. 1 or 2 topics like debugging and Big O were not explored much <br>153.
 Everything was pretty much perfect except that a reading a text book  
which was proposed but not implemented well  should also be encouraged  
Not that it is actually needed but it would enhance the course 
experience <br>154. Stanford<br>155. Work load too heavy<br>156. Less practice material<br>157. NOPE<br>158. Through other people who knew told me that the thing taught in one sem was very less<br>159. Late results<br>160. The oversimplified nature<br>161. We use different libraries in class and different in labs         Time limit of lectures     <br>162. Difference between spl and stl library<br>163. Exams<br>164. Confusion regarding standard and stanford library<br>165. slow speed<br>166. Funnily enough  the assignments of col100  Jokes apart  I don t think the course was in any way detestable <br>167. I dislike the assignment deadlines and timings  We were given assignment at wrong time during rdv and now in majors <br>168. It is available only in sem 1  Wanted the course to be extended further<br>169. Assignments at the time of holidays <br>170. The teachers did not even introduce us to world of competitive coding which i would really like to explore<br>171. Assignment<br>172. sometopics were not covered like classes structures  <br>173. Work load was too less  So I used to lose track <br>174.
 Minors are paper pen test  which does not go with this course  Either 
minors may be computed based  or graded assignments should be given more
 weightage <br>175. very fast<br>176. Ungraded assignment <br>177. Sometimes codes are very hard<br>178. The workload given for each week was too much<br>179. The difficulty of exams <br>180. None<br>181. Assignment difficulty level rose exponentially  <br>182. Nothing<br>183. Ungraded assignments<br>184. If more practice problems were given  it could have been better <br>185. Nothing<br>186. Sometimes lecture got boring<br>187. I felt one and half hour lecture was too tiring <br>188. it was the best course<br>189. Assignment were given regularly which contains very hard logical thinking and time provided was limited<br>190. Partially graded assignment <br>191. Course was not focused on probleme solving <br>192. At times the graded assignments were a bit lengthy and caused confusion that which member functions to use  <br>193. Everything<br>194. Nothing <br>195. Many lectures were repetitive <br>196. little bit hard for bigginers<br>197. Restricted to use Stanford library in moodle<br>198. Nothing<br>199. Not enough emphasis on learning syntax<br>200. No comments<br>201. Only that it might have been taught better if the teacher could code along more often<br>202. No opinion <br>203. Nothing<br>204. Nithing<br>205. It was very hard to thik about codes<br>206. No proper help provided to learn the course NOT AT ALL <br>207. none <br>208.
 The TA s weren t that helpful to our learning  Didn t teach something 
new and different  Everything was left on lectures  Lab sessions were 
not useful at all <br>209. Length of lectures<br>210. It s syllabus<br>211. Assignments took so much time that was so bothering but that was for practice so i can find my mistakes <br>212. Too much load  Codes and codes everywhere  <br>213. length of class <br>214. Assignment somtimes reduse the time to be given to other courses  <br>215. Many a times get stuck in a question which wastes a lot of time<br>216. Nothing<br>217. nothing<br>218. the labs sessions<br>219. Syntax was not so much stressed<br>220. Assignments<br>221.
 The question paper in the majors was mostly focused on a single topic  
We should have been allowed to do the questions using the method we want
  We are just beginners to programming  <br>222. Nothing <br>223. The course we going slowly <br>224. end part is very subtle<br>225. Nothing<br>226. theory<br>227. As such no topic<br>228. Everything<br>229. As I was new to CS course and this course does not encourage me to take interest in it <br>230. assignments given are not enough to give a good grasp of understanding of subject<br>231. Work load<br>232. Nothing<br>233. Nothing <br>234. Nothing<br>235. it involved too much thinking and there was no direct way to get to the logic <br>236. Stanford Library functions <br>237. The evaluation didn t support partial grading  Either we got a 0 or full <br>238. Very hard<br>239. none<br>240. Nothing<br>241. lecture classes<br>242. No opinion<br>243. Assignments load<br>244. timr taking<br>245. Nothing<br>246. some of the graded assignments were too tough<br>247. Graded assignments<br>248. it coverd a lots of content which was as per me not of use for me<br>249. assignments are very difficult and question in exams are also very difficult <br>250. Nothing as such<br>251. nothing in particular <br>252. Just that the classes would become boring because the professor could not make the classes very interesting <br>253. in assignments you can not see the all testcases so it makes hard to check the the fault in code  <br>254. graded assignment hardness move in a step wise manner rather it should be in graduall increase <br>255. Length of lecture<br>256. Everything<br>257. Nothing<br>258.
 Links to relevant practice problems were not given  teaching us 
Stanford library meant we couldn t practice some code on other sites  
That was rectified though <br>259. nothing<br>260. There are too many assignments  <br>261.
 We used two libraries and so had to memorise two pair of functions   
The course was more oriented towards marks and grades than towards 
actual learning <br>262. Only two classes a week <br>263. It was not that much able to keep student s constant intrest in it  <br>264. nothing<br>265. Course was bit tough  Less practice and  lack of good questions <br>266. The confusion that was created due to the use of Stanford library <br>267. The workload was a bit too much<br>268.
 The marking scheme of grading the online assignments was not up to the 
mark  for eg if a student has written the whole code correct  but just 
due the tiniest error  he she is getting a 0 out of 10 or 20  This wasn t
 justified <br>269. was tough in the beginning<br>270. It ended so early  huh<br>271. nothing<br>272. the material was too short<br>273. Nothing <br>274. No opinion<br>275. Can t Comment <br>276. due to having problem in english language i didn t learn course much<br>277. I found that questions asked in examination are difficult from that in assignments and lectures  <br>278. Assignments were given at wrong time<br>279. nothing<br>280.
 As it was a completely new thing for me it requires me more time to 
understand things but due to too difficult graded assignments it causes 
loss of time which I decided to give to other subjects  <br>281. A bit fast<br>282.
 The course revolves around just data structures  If you could teach 
something more than that  it would have been more interesting <br>283. Our teacher is very good but sometimes he explains too much and focus on small things a bit too much <br>284. At times i was forced to spend my whole days work on this subject  I mean the work load is heavy during some weeks <br>285. Lack of practice and confusion regarding standard library<br>286. Confusion among libraries<br>287. Non graded assignment are very bad <br>288. assignments <br>289. We were taught very less algorithms<br>290. somtimes boring lectures<br>291. nothing<br>292. The codes that the professor make should be made of some ide as in some cases even the prof conveys some wrong thing<br>293. Nothing as such<br>294. When program don t work in assignment<br>295. Presentation was not that great <br>296. sometimes graded assignments <br>297. Too easy  didn t cover much about c   or logical thinking<br>298. The pace becomes slow at the end of the course <br>299. Nothing as such<br>300. Nothing<br>301. Nothing<br>302. There was confusion between standard and stanford library function <br>303. Nothing<br>304. Maybe more could be taught<br>305. introduction of multiple libraries in doing the same sort of work  <br>306. nope<br>307. Nothing  much<br>308. I think the Non Graded assignments as they should be Automatically evaluated though Not graded<br>309. The grading process of assignments<br>310.
 This couse is totally imposed over us  We didn t take this department 
by our choice then also it has been taught to us  We are not able to 
learn clearly because we were not having any computer background <br>311. There is no proper merhod to teach <br>312.
 The lab was a source of great pain  The attendance policy of the lab 
was never made clear The TAs left much to be desired in all aspects  The
 introduction of partially graded assignments was also disliked  There 
was never clarity regarding their weightage <br>313. in the minors  time
 alloted was quite less  given the fact that most of us new to coding  
though we had the logic  we failed to express it in the paper coz of 
time crunch<br>314. The course is too hectic  <br>315. nothing<br>316. I disliked the fact that we always had the burden of a graded assignment every alternate week  that too with a deadline  <br>317. No comment <br>318. I found some graded assignment too difficult compared to the level taught in class<br>319. the variation between depth of topic discussed in the class versues questions asked in graded assignments and examinations <br>320. Nothing <br>321. nothing<br>322. Difficulty<br>323.
 The thing I disliked about the course is that instead of the graded 
assignments  there should be number of pen and paper tests <br>324. the way it was taught in class<br>325. It was very difficult for me  I was struggling till last  <br>326. Very few examples were discussed in class <br>327. question papers were hard <br>328. the minors and majors were taken on paper  which destroys the essence of coding<br>329. The pace to cope up with theentirely new topic for newbies <br>330. Graded assignments weren t balanced  Either they were too easy or too difficult <br>331. a repeatition of most of the things for me<br>332. grading scheme<br>333. assignments<br>334. Nothing<br>335. Different function libraries were introduced <br>336. assignment deadlines  <br>337. PARAG SINGHLA S HANDWRITING<br>338. Confusion among libraries<br>339. The load of this course is the most on us <br>340. Nothing<br>341. There are many tough questions that can take days to answer <br>342. Everything<br>343. Nothing <br>344. Course itself<br>345. nothing<br>346.   ll <br>347. Assignments <br>348. lectures were kind of boring <br>349. nothing <br>350. Work load     every week a new assignment and the pressure to complete before the deadline<br>351. Prof    <br>352. The grading policy which was not finalised or not informed to the students  in time  <br>353. Change of library function<br>354. Nothing<br>355. introduction of Stanford library<br>356. Nothing<br>357. This course shouldn t be compulsory to all department students <br>358. nothing in particular <br>359. Work load<br>360. It was little tough for people without prior knowledge <br>361. Course workload was too heavy<br>362. no opinion<br>363. no comments<br>364. Nothing <br>365. nothing<br>366. no<br>367. the batch size<br>368. Everything<br>369. no<br>370. n<br>371. exam and assignment questions<br>372. The assignments were too difficult considering that most students have never done coding in their schooling<br> <br><br>

<strong>Q. No. 3 : Any Suggestions or comments about the course.</strong> (Responses: 349)<br><br>1. nothing<br>2. tell us syntax more clearly<br>3. No Opinion <br>4. No<br>5. Na<br>6.

NA<br>15. nothing<br>16. nope<br>17. give more practice questions and more solved examples  and practice assignments according to those in exams <br>18. no<br>19. Do not teach Stanford library <br>20. It would be good if you slow down the pace and teach everything from basics  <br>21. No<br>22. No suggestions<br>23. Course should be easy<br>24. Methods should be devised to develope analytical thinking skills for problem solving <br>25. No comments<br>26.
 More questions and examples should be included in the course  Without 
sufficient examples and practice  we are asked to solve graded 
assignments  The typed theory is not satisfactory in terms of clarity 
and examples <br>27. I think assignment s solution should be pasted on moodle <br>28. marks distribution should be told earlier<br>29. A slightly lower difficulty <br>30. no<br>31. No suggestions <br>32. No <br>33. All the assignments given in this course should only be allowed to do live in the lab sessions <br>34. Update the course and made it according to  need of industry<br>35. no comments<br>36. no thank you<br>37. remove carrel part    it misdirects students and makes us lose interest in coding <br>38. no   <br>39. This is an interesting course so try to make it more interesting<br>40. no comments<br>41. no<br>42. The workload should be decreased somewhat<br>43. No <br>44. No<br>45.
 There should be practical in the class in which the program should be 
made in front of students so that they can understand easily this course
  <br>46. instructor must explain more example realated to given topic some more interesting topics must be add to lectures<br>47. More time for assignments<br>48. Good course and would like to do such course in future<br>49.
 My suggestions for this course is to make the exam papers little easier
  so that students who are week in this course are also take interest in
 it  <br>50. Slowing down the pace and deep explanation of the topic would be beneficial <br>51. Java should be introduced <br>52.
 Pleaseeeeeee Rethink the validity of the course  It isnt a course to be
 done over 4 months time   It requires more time and exposure for first 
timers This course can definitely be replaced by something better  It 
simply killed off my interest inthesubject <br>53. No<br>54. No suggestions   <br>55. No<br>56. During start you should make students practice<br>57. Good one  <br>58. No<br>59. Those who have not done coding before should be taught from basics<br>60. No<br>61. No<br>62. Don t know <br>63. reduce the graded assg <br>64. No<br>65. No<br>66. The syllabus should be presented more clearly as to what we will be able to do with the knowledge of the topic  <br>67. more questions can be done in class to get a detailed idea about the topic<br>68. no<br>69. No comments<br>70. No comments<br>71. Not much<br>72.
 This course should be planned differently for the students who know 
coding before the start of this course and the ones who do not have any 
coding background  <br>73. No<br>74. Teacher should uploaded practice 
programs related to the topic that they thought in the classroom as soon
 as possible and their should no deadline for them  <br>75. syllabus should be short<br>76. It could exclude some of the topics taught <br>77. No<br>78.
 i want to study col    but my bad cg restricts me to do so  please help
 me to get a minor course in col  because it began to fascinates me in 
the end when my cg was already drained badly <br>79. No suggestions<br>80. Practice questions and extra help session should be kept instead of unnecessary labs where we go only to kill the time <br>81. More help seesion can be provided  <br>82. Children should be segregated on the basis of their earlier exposure to the subject <br>83. None<br>84. Level of graded assignments should be less  <br>85. More content can be taught  but in the end it s upto the instructors  Pointers could have been taught  <br>86. No<br>87.
 Please try to be more practical  teach us how we can reduce the number 
of errors because sometimes the code written by teacher in class also 
contains many errors and even some member functions which are not 
supported by moodle background <br>88. the level of difficulty should have been increased gradually<br>89. try to keep up with pace of students who haven t coding before and are slow at it<br>90. No <br>91. lectures must be a little more interesting <br>92. None<br>93. you should teach basic of the subject <br>94. More and more practice questions should be given <br>95.
 This course should be taught with more details and in small steps as it
 s very tough for a person like me who had never studied computer 
science at this level to pace up with the spead of the class<br>96. Organise more labs<br>97. Exam should be on computer<br>98. Nope<br>99. No <br>100. NO<br>101. The lenght of assignments is more  Some short assignments should also be given to improve the course understanding <br>102. None<br>103. More topics should be added to this course to make it even more typical and interesting <br>104. No<br>105. Every week  there should be an assignment  which is graded  regularly with a fixed deadline day <br>106. No<br>107. No<br>108. A sheet of questions should be provided for more practice just like tutorials in other courses  <br>109.
 Remove lab assignment for marks so that only the ones can do who have 
interest in coding Wants no pressurisation on students regarding this <br>110. Improve Labs TA and increase the participants of teacher in labs<br>111. My GAs arent graded  please grade my GAs<br>112. None<br>113. Detailed plannings should be given at the beginning <br>114. None<br>115. Nothing much  <br>116. None <br>117. No need<br>118. Using debuuger linux stanford etc  All this i could not learn<br>119. No comments<br>120. None<br>121. there should be lab tests instead of lab assignments and have to be completed in the lab itself so that there is no copying<br>122. None<br>123. Please give assignments in a easy to difficult way<br>124. Graded assignments must be bound to be done in confined environment<br>125. NO<br>126.
 Students should be given proper and exact feeling of the course of what
 we are going to do in this course and why we are learning this  The 
students are taught  hello world  program in the very first lecture and 
many people take time to except the thing <br>127. No <br>128. make interesting as much as possible<br>129. More data structures and member functions should be included<br>130. no<br>131. no<br>132.
 the thing I want to suggest is that they should provide testcases for 
ungraded assignment too and it should also have a auto evaluating system<br>133.
 It would be nice to create some sort of extra work learning 
opportunities for the ones who already have learnt the course topics 
beforehand <br>134. Good can be improved <br>135. Very less questions 
are given for the practice  As assignment is given for 1 week  4 
questions are very less and can be increased to 10 as their is 
sufficient time <br>136. Theory books required  <br>137. Must be given more hours   credits<br>138. Nothing<br>139. Nope <br>140. No<br>141.
 give more emphasis on linking different contents of the course with 
each other  also answers to lab assignments should be discussed in class
 after the deadline <br>142. no<br>143. Almost everything is good<br>144. This course is 10 on 10 <br>145. No<br>146. Ungraded assignments should have same evaluation platform as graded assignments<br>147. NOPE<br>148. none<br>149. Could split in two batches on basis of prior knowledge<br>150. Reduce the lecture duration<br>151. Good<br>152. Increase assignment weight age and decrease exam weight age <br>153. Nothing<br>154. none<br>155.
 May be some tweaks in course structure  Some concepts like pointers and
 iterators could have been introduced earlier in the course <br>156. The course is good and gives an insight into world of coding  It was taught very well<br>157. Duration should be extended to cover more topic <br>158. Very good course<br>159. Please take care of what i said in the disliked part <br>160. No<br>161. till now  i found Parag Singla as the best teacher in iit<br>162. There should be more practice problems given <br>163. None <br>164. slow the course<br>165. All assignments should be graded   No ungraded assignment   <br>166. Moodle playground for all even those who are not registered for course and it should work from non iitd wifi<br>167. Level of difficulty for graded assignment should be increased gradually not instantly as done in our case  <br>168. More practice questions on later topics as those difficult <br>169. Graded Assignments not counted as said<br>170. No<br>171. Please add more practice problems <br>172. No suggestions<br>173. Video lectures are needed <br>174. for those students who does not know more about computer an extera class should be conducted <br>175. Course planning should be done properly<br>176. Assignments were more helpful than examination  <br>177. More problems should be discussed in the class <br>178. Include live computer programming during lectures <br>179. Time waste<br>180. Everything is fine about this course  <br>181. Less time should be spent on previous topics<br>182.  nice     <br>183. Please teach both library function in class itself<br>184. Well handled<br>185. No comments<br>186. None<br>187. No opinion <br>188. More grading assignment from last topic<br>189. No<br>190. More practise questions should be provided to students<br>191. No opinion <br>192. the assignments could have been graded based on how efficient they were rather than only on test case passing  <br>193.
 In lab sessions new concepts may be taught or at least students should 
be motivated or helped out to learn them on their own  <br>194. I think it s name should have been CPP100<br>195. I haven t any suggestions <br>196. class can be of shorter length<br>197. No comments  <br>198. No comments<br>199. No<br>200. nothing<br>201. nah<br>202. No<br>203. No<br>204.
 The number of graded and their contribution to the course in terms of 
marks should be increased while improving the regulations against those 
who practice plagiarism Provide more practice problems as i was unable 
to get adequate practice  hence low grade  <br>205. Nothing<br>206. Difficulty of graded assignment should be increased and the teaching speed of course should beade faster <br>207. no opinion<br>208. No<br>209. no<br>210. More ungraded questions should be there<br>211. No<br>212. Please make it more interesting so that we go along with the course and do something better <br>213. More practice may improve understanding <br>214. Lecture notes should be given more briefly<br>215. Nice and superb course <br>216. I felt like this was the perfect way to introduce us to computer science and it couldn t ave been any better <br>217. It s great<br>218. everything is good about this course and nothing need to be change <br>219. We should be provided more test cases in graded assignments <br>220. No<br>221. none<br>222. No<br>223. there should be more lab sessions  the which is delivered should also be in labs so that we can understand more<br>224. No opinion<br>225. no<br>226. teacher should teach students from begining and basics so that the student who is new to the course can also understand <br>227. It was too heavy  Every week you get new assignment <br>228. it is a fine course<br>229.
 Graded assignments must be given at such time so that we can do them 
freely and without any pressure       also problems must be made such 
that there are least chances of cheating <br>230. the course should have been more logical than being lengthy<br>231. Due to tough questions many of us lost interest in this subject <br>232. No<br>233. it should include topics on how computer memory works at the most basic level <br>234. everything is fine just look into the assignments testcase matter  <br>235. to achieve gradual increase in progress their should  be an increase in no  of assignment<br>236. Reducing the lecture duration<br>237. No comments<br>238. Nothing<br>239. Maybe not teach Stanford library  a standard progression would let us make use of other online sources <br>240. no comments<br>241. No suggestions <br>242. Please use only one library<br>243. Submission procedure of assignments should be explained in the class <br>244. It was good<br>245. no<br>246. It should be made easy as students don t know about it in detail and they had not done it before <br>247. Please do not use Stanford library <br>248. None <br>249. No <br>250. none<br>251. I wish i could pursue this course but i cant due to inflexible system of iit<br>252. no<br>253. no comments<br>254. No<br>255. No opinion<br>256. The class could have been a bit more in the beginning of the course <br>257. no<br>258. No<br>259. no<br>260. instead of explaning much  examples must be shown  <br>261. Course speed should be made moderate<br>262. Everything thing is good but I think the pace of this course can be increased a bit<br>263. no comments<br>264. May follow a book so that students learning coding for the first time can get help from the book<br>265. No <br>266. Everything is fine <br>267. nothing<br>268. Can involve mathematics more<br>269. increase no  of graded assts and decrease no  of non graded ones<br>270. the best course of this semester and also the best instructor <br>271. Should increase the region to be covered<br>272. None  It was fine <br>273. No <br>274. None<br>275. nil<br>276. Increase algorithmic thinking and understanding of c    especially object oriented programming <br>277. No comments <br>278. Keep it up<br>279. No<br>280. None<br>281. Only Standard library should be taught<br>282. Good questions must be uploaded in some website <br>283. The Computer Science Courses must be more than 2 in each semester as CS IT is the flourishing Industry of this time <br>284. if stanford libraries were taught then only those functions should be taught that are not present in stl  <br>285. nope<br>286. The course was good<br>287. Try including more concepts in the course<br>288. No<br>289.
 Please put some options for non intrested students of computer science 
 Because some students are from poor backgrounds  they even don t know 
how the computer works <br>290. Try to be more practical and spend more time <br>291.
 It would be helpful  especially before the exams  if there were 
practice questions  non graded  that could be done by  willing  students
  Also exposure to a little tougher questions would be nice  The 
attendance policy of the lab should be clearly stated <br>292. no<br>293. It would be more helpful if we had more practice questions to help us prepare for the exams  <br>294. No <br>295. No comment <br>296. No <br>297.
 try to think about those who never have been related to programming 
world  so please give some time to understand the topic so that they can
 use their understanding to applicate them in problems  Inshort enough 
time and low workload may increase the succes<br>298. No<br>299. nope<br>300. NO<br>301. Just that a number of pen and paper tests can be conducted instead of the graded assignments   <br>302. no comments<br>303. The lecture sessions can be more interactive and interesting  <br>304. More examples can be discussed and the difficulty level can be subsequently increased in every lecture <br>305. it was good <br>306. The latter part of the course could be taught with a little pace Asit deals with a lot of logical aspect <br>307. Either the content must be reduced or number of lectures must be increased <br>308. introduce oops the students have been using it throughout the course but don t know what it is actually<br>309. practicals should be given more emphasis<br>310. questions should be relatively easy<br>311. More time should be given for completing assignments<br>312. nope <br>313. GRADED ASSIGNMENTS SHOULD BE EVALUATED ACCORDING TOTHE EARLIER COURSE POLICY OF 5 6 <br>314. No<br>315. No<br>316.
 Please include more topics of languages  You can also do that as this 
is only a introductory course so you can teach two languages  each 
language half semester  basics of both <br>317. Should start with more deeper level<br>318. No<br>319. NA<br>320. It is a nice course  <br>321. Course itself<br>322. increase number of assingments and there thoughness level too<br>323. ok need more regulaar homework <br>324. Less assignment <br>325. no<br>326. teach poinnters before abstract data types <br>327. Its interesting <br>328. All are not of same level    People had already studied this earlier<br>329.
 Give us more practice questions to solve  Make the graded assignments 
easier  Have a fixed grading policy in assignments to avoid confusion  <br>330. Good keep it up <br>331. No<br>332. please keep only one library  either Stanford library or stl <br>333. No<br>334. This course is too heavy<br>335. no <br>336. Make the course less intense<br>337. No<br>338. Course saylabus need to be change<br>339. no opinion<br>340. no comments<br>341. Nothing <br>342. no<br>343. no<br>344. none as such<br>345. none<br>346. no<br>347. n<br>348. no<br>349. The assignments should have been a little easier <br> <br><br>

No<br>114. Everything<br>115. No opinion<br>116. The assignments and promotion to think as good and as logical solutions possible<br>117. We can ask doubt from TA s <br>118. The course is very good<br>119. logical thinking<br>120. Encouraging independent thinking<br>121. solving complex programmes<br>122. i am more interested in computers and hence liked all the lectures and assignments so much<br>123.

Writing code was fun <br>220. The course structure<br>221. The teaching assistants were kind and helpful<br>222. helped a lot to learn language<br>223. It was in multiple ways by prof sorav sir<br>224. coding<br>225. the teaching assistants were very helpful<br>226. Sharpens the brain<br>227. Nothing<br>228. TAs was very helpful<br>229. Assignments are good and provide so much understanding of the concepts  <br>230. Proper plan of exams<br>231. everything<br>232. It was about something which I never studied before  <br>233. Labs were good<br>234. It was useful in the starting of the course when we had no idea <br>235. It is the perfect place to clear your doubt<br>236.
 the TA S in the lab were initially helpful  But after introducing the 
partially graded assignments they have insisted us to do the work by 
browsing  Which was really helpful and made me learn how to clear my 
doubts by myself <br>237. NA<br>238. Reasoning and thinking<br>239. Learning new things in every lecture <br>240. Very well structured  interesting assignments  <br>241. c  <br>242.

 This course is good for CS students and the intrested ones  Something 
new is there in this course that might be fine for some students <br>261. Nothing<br>262. Answered above <br>263. all<br>264. the assignments were designed well and helped improve understanding of the topics covered in class in quick time   <br>265.

It made theoretical knowledge applicable <br>270. i don t like much in this course except exposure to the programming world and to evaluate myself <br>271. Assignment <br>272. everything<br>273. I got to learn coding for the first time<br>274. Labs were the best part of the COL course   The provide hands on experience and clears most of our doubts   <br>275. nothing<br>276. As said earlier  it taught us to code <br>277. practical thinking <br>278. The basic understanding of programming languages was made clear <br>279. Inspired doing things that can t be done by just learning the theory and doing things in mind and on paper <br>280.

Ungraded assignments should be graded <br>17. Stanford library <br>18. Having no previous knowledge of coding it was tough<br>19. The lab was sometimes a formality as students openly discussed graded assignments  <br>20. Short time span <br>21. Course<br>22. There was some problems with pc sometimes<br>23. A lil frustration bcoz of not getting marks due to silly mistakes and tim lag  <br>24. Things not taught in class have to be used<br>25. The graded assignments were given without sufficient understanding and practice <br>26. No<br>27. too much of assignments<br>28. Difficulty level <br>29. the time availibility<br>30. Nothing <br>31. Nothing<br>32.
 The assignments should be a test of the students ability and thus 
should be allowed to be done only in the lab sessions in front of the 
TAs<br>33. the graded assignments <br>34. i don t think so  <br>35. whats the use of a practical lab period if we have to do things of our own  we can even do that from hostels <br>36. File I O too many confussions <br>37. Nothing<br>38. nothing<br>39. graded assignments<br>40. Duration of labs<br>41. It was too difficult to understand  <br>42. Nothing<br>43. same as above <br>44.

Work load<br>57. Nothing<br>58. Nothing<br>59. Tough Questions <br>60. Big 0 <br>61. Lengthy ordinary codes<br>62.
 The examples that were taught in the class should have been more 
difficult and vast as it caused a lot problem while solving the graded 
assignment  <br>63. the lecture becomes monotonous after some time and 
the complication related to the use of SPL in class and practice but the
 use STL in graded assignments<br>64. nothing<br>65. No comments<br>66. Everything<br>67. Nothing<br>68.
 No one cares about the difference created between the students who have
 no coding background and the ones who knew coding before <br>69. Heavy Burden<br>70. We do not learn something new  <br>71. nothing <br>72. Work load was too heavy <br>73. Nothing<br>74. It was very tough for me<br>75.
 The questions that were asked in exam were nowhere related to the 
examples done in class  We should have been given practice questions   
All we got was graded assignments which were very tough  It was not 
possible for one  mediocre person do it all alone <br>76. Nothing<br>77. Very tough assignments and exams<br>78. Very tough graded assignments <br>79. The TAs can t pay attention to every student properly <br>80. Too much syllabus<br>81. Tough level of assignments <br>82. the teacher doesn t encourage independent thinking<br>83.
 too much work load and hard stuff  the course seems biased as it is 
quiet easy for students who have learned coding before to score easily 
in early exams like minor 1<br>84. No opinion <br>85. Nothing<br>86. teachers behave like the studnt already know much much about subject<br>87. Less question are done in the lecture<br>88. This course is too tough which eventually results in dying interest in the course <br>89. The way the exams are taken <br>90. Nothing<br>91. None<br>92. Workload of assignments and their deadlines <br>93. THE REGULAR GRADED ASSIGNMENT<br>94. in starting we need to put hard work to get in flow <br>95. Their quantity<br>96. The assignments were big thus finishing them in 1 lab is difficult <br>97.
 TA s sometimes couldn t figure out what all mistakes did we make in our
 assignments thus they were unable to fulfil the elementary task alotted
 to them and this further led to too much time in solving assignments <br>98. Nothing<br>99. All assignments should be graded <br>100. Everything<br>101. Debugging is tiresome<br>102. There should be no lab  <br>103. Everything  Lab is only for ATTENDANCE<br>104. TAs<br>105. My GAs arent graded  please grade my GAs<br>106. None<br>107. the level increased suddenly <br>108. Nothing <br>109. They can t jugde us properly on the basis of these as many people copy steal codes  Innocent people also get blamed <br>110. None <br>111. Nothing happened<br>112. In some cases constraints in questions   <br>113. The intensity and amount of work <br>114. None<br>115. TA s are not helping in good way <br>116. Exams   <br>117. The TA will never approach to you by thier own to ask people whether they are doing well or not <br>118. The course was very good<br>119. nothing<br>120. Lesser frequency of assignments<br>121. nothing<br>122. ungraded assignments were also said to be graded but i didn t understand how would they grade it so felt a bit unclear<br>123. the load of assignments sometimes<br>124. Nothing <br>125. Actually we couldnt learn much frm the course  I was expecting to learn something higher<br>126. nothing particular<br>127. Hectic assignments <br>128. Less hours assigned to course  Also more practical work should be encouraged<br>129. Nothing<br>130. No major requirement of lab <br>131. no sollutions given after the deadline<br>132. Too much pace and not taught before so need more time to get acquainted<br>133. Nothing<br>134.
 They are not weighed properly  Practical questions are  arguably  
harder than questions on minor major yet they are weighed quite less 
than those <br>135. Linux<br>136. Less practice material<br>137. NOPE<br>138. i have no idea of how it could have been better <br>139. Nothing<br>140. Assignment<br>141. Wasting time in labs without anything to do  Though it occured only a few times <br>142. Sometimes we had completed the assignments and had nothing special to do in lab  So  it wasted time <br>143. Assignments asked us to use standard libraries but we were taught stanford ones in lectures <br>144. The teachers did not even introduce us to world of competitive coding which i would really like to explore<br>145. Nothing<br>146. Labs were taken rather lightly  The assignments could be done even outside the labs  which in a way rendered them useless <br>147. Paper pen tests <br>148. deadlines <br>149.

language or not  The solutions themselves were simple <br>163. little bit hard<br>164. Stanford library cannot be used for assignment<br>165. Nothing<br>166. Nothing<br>167.

 The TA s weren t that helpful to our learning  Didn t teach something 
new and different  Everything was left on lectures  Lab sessions were 
not useful at all <br>176. Length of lecture<br>177. Syllabus<br>178. Nothing<br>179. length of class<br>180. Sometime it is time waste  <br>181. Eats up the mind when no clue strikes the mind for solving the question <br>182. Not explaining property and examples were not clear<br>183. Nothing<br>184. n<br>185. the lab sessions<br>186. Heavy homework every week<br>187. Assignments<br>188. writing code on paper is not the best way of programming according to me<br>189. Workload<br>190. end part is very subtle<br>191. nothing<br>192. Everything<br>193. Work load<br>194. Nothing <br>195. Nothing <br>196. The labs were of less duration so we were not able to get maximum advantage out of it <br>197.

Graded assignments<br>204. discipline in lab<br>205. Nothing<br>206. nothing in particular<br>207. in assignments you can not see the all testcases so it makes hard to check the the fault in code <br>208. nothing<br>209. Everything<br>210. In starting we are told that n 1 GA assignment will be evaluated out of n but in end they evaluated all n<br>211. It s frustrating when the code doesn t work <br>212. nothing<br>213. More grade oriented   Use only one library  <br>214. It was not able to keep student s constant intrest in it  <br>215. nothing<br>216. Mixing of standard and Stanford library made it very difficult <br>217. Nothing<br>218. The workload was a bit too much<br>219. nothing<br>220. practical work was less <br>221. Lecture notes are poor explanation wise<br>222. nothing<br>223. lack of assignments<br>224. Nothing<br>225. Everything<br>226. nothig<br>227.
 Assignment copying was checked by a software so sometimes it may happen
 that coincidentally codes of two students match and they were penalized
 although they are innocent <br>228. Moodle grades the assignments weirdly it changes marks everytime even if you write the same code  <br>229. nothing<br>230. It requires too much time  <br>231. Lab were not so interactive<br>232.
 the lab was not helpful later in the course as graded assignments were 
being solved in the labs and so nothing extra was being learnt <br>233. Sometimes the question were very easy and the no  of questions were less <br>234. nothing<br>235. No definite task in the lab<br>236. Confusion on libraries<br>237. Ungraded assignment <br>238. nothing<br>239. Less topics were taught<br>240. NOthing<br>241. nothing<br>242. The codes that the professor make should be made of some ide as in some cases even the prof conveys some wrong thing<br>243. When program don t work<br>244.

Nil<br>253. i answered it already<br>254. nope<br>255. It is at early morning<br>256. Non automatic evaluation of Non Graded assignments<br>257. Grading process<br>258.
 This couse is totally imposed over us  We didn t take this department 
by our choice then also it has been taught to us  We are not able to 
learn clearly because we were not having any computer background <br>259. The TAs weren t helpful<br>260. Answered above <br>261. none<br>262. We can t submit assignments without using iit delhi wifi network   So submitting assignments from home  is not possible    <br>263. The course is too hectic  <br>264. nothing <br>265.
 Some graded assignments required a lot of thinking or debugging  which 
lead to unnecessary pressure on average students like me <br>266. No comment <br>267. Nothing <br>268.
 grading policy of the course  In starting of the course they declared 
that graded assignments will be consisting of 25marks but at the last 
moment they changed their policy so much confusion with lab assignment 
1st declared ungraded then they declare them <br>269. Nothing <br>270. nothing<br>271. Difficulty<br>272. I didn t dislike anything in specific about the course <br>273. nothing<br>274. Very few examples were discussed in class <br>275. question papers were hard <br>276. The pace to cope up with theentirely new topic for newbies <br>277. Occurred just once a week   Should occur twice <br>278. a repeatition of most of the things for me<br>279. time constraints<br>280. nothing<br>281. Nothing<br>282. nothing <br>283.

 It is my belief that students who actually copy graded assignments from
 others  their names do not appear in the list of copying students  
Rather the ones who do not copy  but somehow their code matches with 
someone else  their names appear in that list  <br>290. Course itself<br>291. nothing<br>292. less ta in lab<br>293. Different libraries <br>294. nothing<br>295. nothing much  <br>296. No opinion<br>297. Confusion in SPL and STL initially and forcing us to use QT creator  <br>298. GA was tough<br>299. Nothing<br>300. Stanford library<br>301.

 Our T As were not good at all  They would only mock at us that we don t
 know such easy things  They should understand that we are not qualified
 as them Labs became torturous and waste of time They think that we 
should learn everything in classs only <br>79. Very helpful<br>80. The teaching assistants could be a bit more polite and helpful <br>81. Very nice<br>82. Okay<br>83. Good<br>84. Quite good<br>85. It was effective but only up to some extent <br>86.

 I personally never asked them for any help  However it appeared to be 
quite ineffective  Their casual attitude regarding the students was very
 disappointing <br>276. not much<br>277. It would be more helpful if we had more practice questions to help us prepare for the exams  <br>278. Highly efficient and good <br>279.

It was a nice course but material for problems were not available<br>61. Not any<br>62.
 The lab assignment questions are same for students having coding 
background and for the ones having no coding background  This ultimately
 creates a situation of havoc for the students having no coding 
background<br>63. No<br>64. No<br>65. no<br>66. It could exclude some of the topics taught<br>67. No<br>68. No suggestions<br>69.
 Graded assignments did not do much good as students had to do that out 
of pressure Most take help from others How can this enhance their 
learning We should do coding by interest and not by force Labs should be
 meant for practising ques  not for assgmnts on<br>70. Nothing<br>71. None<br>72. Please reduce difficulty of graded assignments<br>73. It s good<br>74. No<br>75. No<br>76. the level of difficulty should have been increased gradually<br>77. extra support should be given to those who face more difficulty in getting through this<br>78. No<br>79.

No<br>95. Course is going almost as it should<br>96.
 We should remove this course from 1st year so that those interested in 
coding and continue from second year as it should be a extra course<br>97. No<br>98. My GAs arent graded  please grade my GAs<br>99. None<br>100. Better idea should have been given by TAs before the course started about the planning<br>101. None<br>102. None<br>103. No<br>104.
 There is no way we can learn linux gdb qt creator if they were to be 
used barely for 2 hrs a week    Should find a better way to use them not
 everyone have them in personal laptop s<br>105. Conduct majors and minors on computers<br>106. None<br>107. TA s should help us in a good way they should not get irritated to our questions and they should help us in learning<br>108.
 No need to conduct such lab because thier are many other platforms by 
which we can clear our doubts such as by teacher Piazza etc It more like
 TAs to go practical what they are actually meant for<br>109. No<br>110. make it more interesting so that student start more thinking<br>111. More assignments should be present<br>112. nothing<br>113. no<br>114.
 the thing I want to suggest is that they should provide testcases for 
ungraded assignment too and it should also have a auto evaluating system<br>115. No comments<br>116. Good can be improved<br>117. no<br>118. Need of more practice questions to be provided at hand<br>119. Provide more time and teach OOPS part also<br>120. Nothing<br>121. Nope<br>122. improve more<br>123. No<br>124. Nothing<br>125. Increasing it s weightage<br>126. No<br>127. Ungraded assignments should have same evaluation platform as graded assignments<br>128. NOPE<br>129. i have no idea of how it could be done better<br>130. The assignment could be more difficult<br>131. In ungraded assign    compiler should be inbuilt in moodle<br>132. Nothing<br>133. Take attendance early and allow those students to leave who have completed their lab work<br>134.
 The course is good  Labs can be organized in better way  And 
assignments must be given keeping in mind that students have adequate 
time to do them<br>135. No<br>136. Please take care of what i said in the disliked part<br>137. No<br>138. none<br>139. minors in the form of lab<br>140.
 Tell students  that how the coarse is so interesting   Because i know a
 big   of students  are not interested in this coarse<br>141. No<br>142. No suggestions<br>143. No<br>144. None<br>145. No thanks<br>146. No suggestions<br>147. Overall was good<br>148.
 initially sir told us that in assignments only best four would be 
considered But now they are considering all five assignments this is 
wrong they should have been told us initially<br>149. No<br>150. No<br>151. No<br>152. No suggestions<br>153.
 There should be questions which require first thinking logical and 
feasible solution and then thinking about how to implement them<br>154. nice<br>155. Please teach us more about cpp<br>156. No comments<br>157. None<br>158. No opinion<br>159. Can be more better<br>160. No comments<br>161. More practise question should be provided<br>162. No opinion<br>163.
 Students want some motivation and more help to start coding on their 
own for the first time And instead of being strict on them one should 
try to understand their problems  For example if extra help sessions 
were conducted then It would have been more help<br>164. No<br>165.        DO<br>166. I haven t any suggestions<br>167. no comments<br>168. No comment<br>169. No comments<br>170. To make classes more interesting and understanding<br>171. No<br>172. n<br>173. no<br>174. Nothing<br>175. No<br>176.
 open book lab quiz to be included in each lab  open book here means 
that we should be allowed to search the syntax and other functions 
required for the program  This will help us learn the functions<br>177. Very good course and neccesary for learning basics of coding<br>178. no opinion<br>179. No<br>180. No comment s<br>181. Nice and superb course<br>182. I felt like this was the perfect way to introduce us to computer science and it couldn t ave been any better<br>183. The lab session duration should be increased<br>184. Nothing<br>185. there should be more lab sessions<br>186. No<br>187. no<br>188. Please teach in the class from basics<br>189. no<br>190.
 More focus must be on learning  Graded assignments       they were not 
helpful for learning    they were just testing our knowledge  In labs 
TAs must take individual viva of students and not grade that viva  those
 vivas must only focus on learning<br>191. no<br>192. No<br>193. nothing in particular<br>194. everything is fine just look into the assignments testcase matter<br>195. N A<br>196. No comments<br>197. No<br>198. None specifically<br>199. no comments<br>200. Our course coordinator was good and i think this course need some improvement regarding keeping one s intrest and attention<br>201. no<br>202. The course is good but its syllabus should be made easy<br>203.

Keep it up<br>232. None<br>233. TA should check on their own what work student has done in lab<br>234. Nothing much<br>235. Nil<br>236. if stanford libraries were taught then only those functions should be taught that are not present in stl<br>237. nope<br>238. No it is good<br>239. The Course should be taught to more deeper extent<br>240. None<br>241.
 Please put some options for non intrested students of computer science 
 Because some students are from poor backgrounds  they even don t know 
how the computer works<br>242. I don t think so<br>243. Answered above<br>244. no<br>245. No<br>246. More time can be given for graded assignments maybe 2 weeks for an assignment with 5   6 questions<br>247. No comment<br>248. No<br>249.

policy Give appropriate and adequate time for learning a topic overall i

The latter part of the course could be taught with a little pace Asit deals with a lot of logical aspect<br>258. As said above  either course content must be reduced or number of lectures must be increased<br>259. introduce oops the students have been using it throughout the course but don t know what it is actually<br>260. no<br>261. no<br>262. need no change<br>263.
