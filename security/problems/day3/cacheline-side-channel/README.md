1. Build using 'make'
2. Run "./cache-magic" ten times to see the password printed on screen
3. Experiment with different values of "step\_size", "num\_runs", and "cache\_warm\_iter"
   - These parameters can be passed as (optional) command-line arguments
   - For each experiment (with a fixed triple of these parameters), run "./cache-magic" 10 times.
   - Count the maximum number N of correct characters that were identified in one of the ten runs.
   - Plot N with different values of the parameters.  Briefly explain these results.
