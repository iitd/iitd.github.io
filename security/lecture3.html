<li>In the code below, what are some affine-equality invariants at the loop head and the loop tail that may relate the different variables <code>i</code>, <code>sum1</code>, and <code>sum2</code>?</li>

<p>Some examples</p>
<pre><code>{x &gt; 0} y := x + 1 { x &gt; 0 and y &gt; 1 }
{x &gt; 0 and y--&gt;heap and *g1=0} *y := x { x &gt; 0 and y--&gt;heap and *g1=0 and *y &gt; 0 }

</ol>
<pre><code>{Precondition}
while (condition) {

<p>For a candidate loop invariant, check the following Hoare triples:</p>

{ Candidate Loop Invariant } LoopBody ; condition is true { Candidate Loop Invariant}

<li>How should you set the precondition/postcondition? Depends on the application you are targetting.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are interested in identifying the properties that would hold after the loop (e.g., for optimization or verification purposes), then you would set the precondition to whatever is known beginning from the start of the program.</p>
<p>If you are interested in identifying the precondition of a given assertion-failure, then you would set the postcondition to the assert-fail condition.</p>
<p>For the following example:</p>
<pre><code>int foo(int v, int w)
{
  x = v;
  a = w;
  while (c()) {
    //candidate
    x := x + 1;
    a := a - 1;
  }
  assert(x + a != 12);
}</code></pre>
<p>The required hoare triples are</p>
<pre><code>{Candidate} x:=x+1; a:=a-1; c() is true {Candidate}
{Candidate} x:=x+1; a:=a-1; c() is false {x + a != 12}</code></pre>
<p>Does the candidate “x+a != v + w” work?</p>
<p>What about “x+a != 12”?</p>
<p>The final precondition is: “v+w != 12”.</p>

<p>A very relevant example relates to affine invariants:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The grammar of affine invariants is <code>c0+c1*x1+c2*x2+...+cn*xn = 0</code></p></li>
<li><p>Instrument the program to collect the concrete values of variables and the corresponding behaviour, e.g., does this set of values eventually led to an assertion failure. Each set of values can be called a <em>point</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify the <em>smallest affine space</em> that contains these points, and use that as a candidate.</p></li>
<li><p>If the candidate does not satisfy all the Hoare triples, then try the <em>bigger affine spaces</em>. But, the number of bigger affine spaces can be too large to enumerate exhaustively. For example, a large number of distinct planes can pass through a line.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="counterexample-guided">Counterexample-guided</h2>
<p>Again, we will use the example of affine invariants:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Start with the empty space</p></li>
<li><p>Check each hoare-triple. If all hoare triples are satisfied, we are done.</p></li>
<li><p>If some hoare triple is not satisfied, we get a counter-example</p></li>
<li><p>Use the counter-example to <em>enlarge the affine space</em> and goto step 2.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Proof: For integer arithmetic, this process converges within N iterations where N is the number of variables (which are being attempted to be related through an affine invariant).</p>
<h1 id="symbolic-analysis-modeling-memory">Symbolic Analysis : Modeling Memory</h1>
<p>Memory is represented as an <em>array</em>. An array is a function that maps addresses to data, e.g., 32-bit address to 8-bit data. It additionally supports the <em>select</em> and <em>store</em> operations.</p>
<pre><code>select(store(A, a, d), a) == d</code></pre>
<p>However, this representation is usually not sufficient to model the state of a high-level program, e.g., a C program. In the abstract machine of a C program, the array is segmented into heap, stack, global variables, and local variables.</p>
<h2 id="segmenting-memory">Segmenting Memory</h2>
<p>For simplicity, we will first consider only the heap, stack, and global variables. Tackling local variables is slightly tricker because they can be dynamically allocated, and their static identification often requires reasoning about non-contiguous regions of memory. That said, our equivalence checker efficiently models dynamically-allocated local variables while supporting discontiguity, etc.</p>
<p>Each global variable can be identified by a start address and a size. Similarly, the stack can be identified by a start address and a (maximum) size. All other memory belongs to the heap. These constraints can be encoded by encoding the facts that the intervals defined by these <code>(start,size)</code> pairs do not intersect, while submitting them to the SAT/SMT solver. Further, we can encode aliasing constraints (e.g., <code>x</code> can only point within the heap) using similar logical conditions. When we get back the counter-example, it will respect the constraints we encoded using logical formulae.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>int g[100];
int f(int* p, int k, int m, int n, int o)
{
  int l[20];
  int* h = malloc(10);
  l[m] = p[n] + h[(m+n)/2] + 2;
  p[m] = 2*p[o];
  g[m-o] = 20;
  h[k] = 10;
}</code></pre>
