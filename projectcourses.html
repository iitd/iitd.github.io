<html><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=windows-1252"></head><body>Please note a few simple, yet important, guidelines you must follow while registering for Projects and Independent studies:

<ol>
<li>It is important that when you register for these courses you have a within-CSE dept. advisor or co-advisor who has explicitly given their consent in advising you.</li>
<li>If you are planning to do these courses under a faculty member under some other department -- <b>you MUST FIND A CO-ADVISOR within the CSE department. 
If you cannot find a co-advisor, then you have only one option - drop the course. </b> <i>Note that you can consider taking an equivalent course at the host department of your advisor. </i>
</li><li>We will require these details through a form available in the CSE office. You can collect it from the office, fill it, have it signed by your advisor(s) and the within CS dept. co-advisor, and submit it  within the next week. List of students who fail to submit these forms in time will be deregistered from the course. </li>
<li>Note that the within-CSE co-advisor need not be closely involved in your project work, but should at the least:
 <ul><li>Know what the project is about. So, the co-advisor should be as close to the area of the project as possible.</li>
<li>Know how the mid-term and end-term evaluation is happening. Ideally, the CSE co-advisor should be involved in the evaluation process (even if not in the project).</li></ul>
</li><li>It is also necessary that your mid-sem and end-sem evaluations be held according to the guidelines of the CSE department. 
Specifically, all evaluations of COS310 and COD310 have to be conducted in front of a committee (and it should have the department co-advisor involved).</li>
<li>[for COS310 &amp; COD310] Apart from the co-supervision requirement as above, you also need to write a few paragraphs about the proposed work to be undertaken and have it approved by one of the three professors from the CSE department supervising your batch.</li>

If you have any further questions/clarifications, do not hesitate to ask.

<p>
