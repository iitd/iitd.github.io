<h1>Beginner's Guide to Creating Research Videos</h1>
<em>Sorav Bansal</em>

This is a beginner's guide to creating research videos. This
guide is originally
intended for faculty members and students in the
<a href=http://cse.iitd.ac.in>CSE Department</a> at IIT Delhi. Others are
also welcome to read it at their own risk.

<h2>Hardware Equipment Required</h2>
You would typically require at least the following equipment to be able to
record a video:
<ul>
	<li>A video camera</li>
	<li>An audio player and recorder</li>
	<li>A computer connected to the video camera and the audio recorder</li>
</ul>
A typical laptop with an in-built webcam usually suffices.  Except that for
better audio quality, you may want to connect an external USB or Bluetooth
speaker-cum-recorder to it.  Some laptops are pre-equipped with high-quality
audio equipment, while others may have problems like low reception/volume.
An external speaker-cum-recorder may be required for the latter category
of laptops/computers.

<h2>Software Tools</h2>
There is a plethora of tools available to record and edit videos. Here
are two tools with which I have had personal experience, and found them
reasonably easy to use and well featured. Importantly, these tools are
free and open-source.
<ul>
	<li><a href=https://obsproject.com/>OBS Studio</a>
		<ul>
			<li>Available on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><a href=https://www.pitivi.org/>Pitivi</a>
		<ul>
			<li>Available on Linux.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><a href=https://openshot.org/>Pitivi</a>
		<ul>
			<li>Available on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps in creating a research video</h2>
A research video could be of several types.  In this discussion, I will assume that you have
a set of slides (e.g., PowerPoint, PDF, Google Slides, etc.), and you are interested in
presenting them such that the video of you explaining those slides appears along with
the slides (e.g., as an inset).  The approach for creating other types of videos (e.g.,
just you talking without any slides) is not too different, and usually simpler.
