<h1>Beginner's Guide to Creating Research Videos</h1>
<em>Sorav Bansal</em>

<p>This is a beginner's guide to creating research videos. This
guide is originally
intended for faculty members and students in the
<a href=http://cse.iitd.ac.in>CSE Department</a> at IIT Delhi. Others are
also welcome to read it at their own risk.

<h2>Hardware Equipment Required</h2>
You would typically require at least the following equipment to be able to
record a video:
<ul>
	<li>A video camera</li>
	<li>An audio player and recorder</li>
	<li>A computer connected to the video camera and the audio recorder</li>
</ul>
A typical laptop with an in-built webcam usually suffices.  Except that for
better audio quality, you may want to connect an external USB or Bluetooth
speaker-cum-recorder to it.  Some laptops are pre-equipped with high-quality
audio equipment, while others may have problems like low reception/volume.
An external speaker-cum-recorder may be required for the latter category
of laptops/computers.

<h2>Software Tools</h2>
There is a plethora of tools available to record and edit videos. Here
are two tools with which I have had personal experience, and found them
reasonably easy to use and well featured. Importantly, these tools are
free and open-source.
<ul>
	<li><a href=https://obsproject.com/>OBS Studio</a>
		<ul>
			<li>Available on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><a href=https://www.pitivi.org/>Pitivi</a>
		<ul>
			<li>Available on Linux.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><a href=https://openshot.org/>OpenShot Video Editor</a>
		<ul>
			<li>Available on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>High-level steps in creating a research video</h2>
A research video could be of several types.  In this discussion, I will assume that you have
a set of slides (e.g., PowerPoint, PDF, Google Slides, etc.), and you are interested in
presenting them such that the video of you explaining those slides appears along with
the slides (e.g., as an inset).  The approach for creating other types of videos (e.g.,
just you talking without any slides) is not too different, and usually simpler.

Broadly speaking, here are the steps required to create a research video:
<ol>
	<li>Create a presentation in your favourite software (e.g., PowerPoint). If you
		want to include videos in your presentation, do not include them
		in your slides. Instead, you could use a video editor to splice
		those videos into your presentation video (as explained later on this page).
	        Ensure that your presentation is approachable for a generalist, and not meant
	        for an expert audience in your specific research area.  Also ensure that your
	        presentation is not longer than the stipulated time (e.g., 3-5 minutes).  It
	        is always a good idea to practice and time your presentation
		multiple times, before starting with the recording
	        routine.</li>
	<li>Open the Video Recording Software, or <em>VRS</em>, (e.g., OBS Studio) and the Presentation
		Software, or <em>PS</em> (e.g., Microsoft Powerpoint) simultaneously on your computer.
		Set up the &quot;video sources&quot; in the VRS such that one video source
		is the PS window (in which you are presenting your slides) and the other video source
		is the camera attached to your computer (which can record you while you are speaking
		and presenting your slides). The full details on how to set up these video
	sources in your VRS are discussed below.</li>
	<li>Press the "Start Recording" button in the Video Recording Software (VRS), open
		the Presentation Software (PS) window and present your work looking into the
		camera, as you would normally do.  Try to be clear and fluent
		in your speech (hopefully you have practiced multiple times already) and ensure that
		your speech matches with the slides that you are presenting on your computer screen.
	        Also try to look into the camera at all times.  In general, it is a good idea
	        to introduce intonations in your voice to add effect as your are describing your
	        work, e.g., for emphasis.  If you want to intersperse an existing video (e.g., some
	        kind of video related to your research) with your presentation, simply pause for
	        a few seconds.  For example, you may say, &quot;... and here is a video that
		demonstrates my research... &lt;pause for 5 seconds&gt; ... resume speaking as
	        though the video has been shown&quot;.  As we will discuss later, these pauses
	        can be edited out and your videos can be edited in using a video editing software.</li>
	<li>When you are finished with your presentation, press the "Stop Recording" button in the VRS.
	    By now, you have created a raw video footage of you presenting your work.
	    You can review this raw video footage by playing it in the Video Recording Software itself. You
	    can also export this video to a format of your choice and have it reviewed by your collaborators
	    if you like.</li>
	<li>The final step is editing the raw presentation video footage using a Video Editing Software, or
		<em>VES</em>.  We explain this step in full detail later on this page.</li>
</ol>
