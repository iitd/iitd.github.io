<h1>Guide to Creating Research Videos</h1>

<p>This is a beginner's guide to creating research videos. This
guide is originally
intended for faculty members and students in the
<a href=http://cse.iitd.ac.in>CSE Department</a> at IIT Delhi. Others are
also welcome to read it at their own risk.

<h2>Hardware Equipment Required</h2>
You would typically require at least the following equipment to be able to
record a video:
<ul>
	<li>A video camera</li>
	<li>An audio player and recorder</li>
	<li>A computer connected to the video camera and the audio recorder</li>
</ul>
A typical laptop with an in-built webcam usually suffices.  Except that for
better audio quality, you may want to connect an external USB or Bluetooth
speaker-cum-recorder to it.  Some laptops are pre-equipped with high-quality
audio equipment, while others may have problems like low reception/volume.
An external speaker-cum-recorder may be required for the latter category
of laptops/computers.

<h2>Software Tools</h2>
There is a plethora of tools available to record and edit videos. We
share instructions for using the
tools with which we have had personal experience. We have
found these tools to be
reasonably easy to use and well featured.
Importantly, these tools are
free and open-source.

<p>
In general, two types of software are required for creating
a short research video: <em>Video Recording
	Software</em> (<b>VRS</b>) that is used for the actual video recording;
 and <em>Video Editing Software</em> (<b>VES</b>) that is used
to edit the raw video
 footage to create a final version. <b>You are not required to edit the
video yourself.</b> You can simply record your talk using the
VRS ad then share it with the video-editing team. The video-editing
team could help edit the video.  However, in some cases, you may prefer
to edit the video yourself before handing it over to the video-editing
team (e.g., if you wanted to join split and join two or more videos
yourself). Thus we provide instructions for both VRS and VES on this page.

<p>
Here are our recommendations for the VRS and the VES.  These are
based on our own experience.  You are free to use your own favourite tools
instead, if you prefer.

<h2>High-level steps in creating a research video</h2>
A research video could be of several types.  In this discussion, we will assume that you have
a set of slides (e.g., PowerPoint, PDF, Google Slides, etc.), and you are interested in
presenting them such that the video of you explaining those slides appears along with
the slides (e.g., as an inset).  The approach for creating other types of videos (e.g.,
just you talking without any slides) is not too different, and usually simpler.

<p>
Broadly, here are the steps required to create a research video:
<ol>
	<li>Create a presentation in your favourite software (e.g., PowerPoint).
		<ul>
			<li>Ensure that your presentation is approachable for a generalist, and not meant
				for an expert audience in your specific research area.</li>
			<li>Also ensure that your
	        presentation is not longer than the stipulated time.  It
	        is always a good idea to practice and time your presentation
		multiple times, before starting to record. <b>The presentation should be no
    longer than five minutes</b>. The editorial
    team will enforce this time limit strictly. The editorial team encourages
    shorter videos, as they typically have wider reach and higher impact.
			<li>If you
		want to include other videos in your presentation, do not include them
		in your slides. Instead, a video editor software (VES) could be used to splice
		those videos into your presentation video. You could do this editing work
    yourself, or you may prefer to clearly provide instructions to our video-editing
    team who may do this editing work on your behalf.</li>
	        </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Open the Video Recording Software, or <em>VRS</em>, (e.g., OBS Studio) and the Presentation
		Software, or <em>PS</em> (e.g., Microsoft Powerpoint) simultaneously on your computer.
		Set up the &quot;video sources&quot; in the VRS such that one video source
		is the PS window (in which you are presenting your slides) and the other video source
		is the camera attached to your computer (which can record you while you are speaking
		and presenting your slides). The full details on how to set up these video
	sources OBS Studio are discussed in the OBS tutorial linked above.</li>
	<li>Press the "Start Recording" button in the Video Recording Software (VRS), open
		the Presentation Software (PS) window and present your work looking into the
		camera, as you would normally do. 
		<ul>
			<li>Try to be clear and fluent
		in your speech --- hopefully you have already practiced multiple times already. Ensure that
		your speech matches with the movement of the slides that you are presenting on your computer screen.</li>
			<li>You may want
	        to introduce intonations in your voice to add effect as you are describing your
		work, e.g., for emphasis.</li>
			<li>If you want to intersperse an existing video (e.g., some
	        kind of video related to your research) with your presentation, simply pause for
	        a few seconds.  For example, you may say, &quot;... and here is a video that
		demonstrates our research... &lt;pause for 5 seconds&gt; ... resume speaking as
	        though the video has been shown&quot;.  These pauses
	        can be edited out later using a video editing software (VES).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>When you are finished with your presentation, press the "Stop Recording" button in the VRS.
	    By now, you have created a raw video footage of you presenting your work.
	    You can review this raw video footage by playing it in the VRS itself. You
	    can also export this video to a format of your choice and have it reviewed by your collaborators
	    if you like.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Editorial Process</h2>
The editorial board consists of at least two faculty members and potentially some
PhD students.  The editorial board would carefully review your video, and evaluate
it for clarity and approachability for a general audience.  The editorial board
will <em>not</em> evaluate your video for its technical research contributions.

<p>
Based on this evaluation, the editorial board may either accept your video, or
may provide some feedback to the authors on how the video's clarity and approachability
may be improved.  We will ensure that at least one faculty
member who has reviewed your video is outside your research area, because we
are primarily interested in evaluating whether the video is approachable for
a non-expert audience.

<p>
Thank you, and look forward to a good set of research videos, that may help us
communicate the nice work we are doing to a wider audience.
