<h3>Dataflow Analysis</h3>

<p>Recall the simple basic-block optimizations
<ul>
	<li> Constant propagation</li>
	<li> Dead code elimination</li>
</ul>
<pre>
X := 3
Y := Z + W
Q := X + Y
</pre>
to
<pre>
X := 3
Y := Z + W
Q := 3 + Y
</pre>
to (if X is not used anywhere else)
<pre>
Y := Z + W
Q := 3 + Y
</pre>

<p>These optimizations can be extended to an entire control-flow graph (CFG).
<pre>
BB1:
X := 3
B &gt; 0 then goto BB2
         else goto BB3

BB2:
Y := Z + W

BB3:
Y := 0

BB4:
A := 2 * X
</pre>
Here we can substitute X with 3 in BB4.

<p>Another example
<pre>
BB1:
X := 3
B &gt; 0 then goto BB2
         else goto BB3

BB2:
Y := Z + W
X := 4

BB3:
Y := 0

BB4:
A := 2 * X
</pre>
Now we cannot replace X with 3 in BB4 even though X is only assigned constants.

<p>How do we know if it is OK to globally propagate constants?

<p>To replace a use of <code>x</code> by a constant <code>k</code>, we
must know: <em>On every path to the use of <code>x</code>, the last assignment
	to <code>x</code> is <code>x := k</code></em>.

<p>Let's look at the first example.  Indeed this condition is satisfied for X:=3 at BB4.

<p>Let's look at the second example. This condition is <em>not</em> satisfied for <code>X</code> at BB4.

<p>The correctness condition is not trivial to check. "All paths" includes paths around loops and through branches of conditionals.

<p>Checking the condition requires <em>global dataflow analysis</em>, i.e., an analysis of the entire CFG.

<p>In general, global optimization tasks share several traits:
<ul>
	<li> The optimization depends on knowing a property <code>X</code> at a particular point in program execution.</li>
	<li> Proving <code>X</code> at any point requires knowledge of the entire program.</li>
	<li>It is OK to be conservative. If the optimization requires <code>X</code> to be true, then want to know either:
		<ul>
			<li><code>X</code> is definitely true.</li>
			<li>Don't know if <code>X</code> is true.</li>
			<li>It is always safe to say "don't know".</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Global dataflow analysis is a standard technique for solving problems with these characteristics. Global constant propagation is an example of such a problem.
