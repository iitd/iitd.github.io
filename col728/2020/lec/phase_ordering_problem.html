<h3>Interactions of data-flow analyses</h3>
One data-flow analysis can improve the results of another data-flow analysis and vice-versa.
Classic example: constant propagation and unreachable code elimination: performing constant propagation
and folding may replace branch predicates with constant boolean values, enabling more code to be identified as unreachable; conversely, eliminating unreachable code can remove non-constant assignments to variables, thus improving the precision of constant-propagation.
There are many more examples of mutually-beneficial interactions of different data-flow analyses.

<em>Phase-ordering problem</em>: if two or more analyses are mutually beneficial, then any ordering of the analyses in which each is run only once may yield sub-optimal results. Some common responses to the
phase-ordering problem:
<ul>
	<li>Carefully choose the order; allow the same analysis to be performed multiple times if needed.</li>
	<li>Use a meta-fixed-point loop that applies all analyses in a sequence and keeps repeating it, until there is no change.</li>
</ul>
Unfortunately, in the presence of loops, even the meta-fixed-point approach may yield sub-optimal
result. This is so because: when analyzing a loop, optimistic initial assumptions must be made simultaneously
for all mutually beneficial analyses to reach the best solution: performing the analyses separately, in effect, makes the pessimistic assumptions about the solutions of all other analyses, from which it is not possible to recover, simply by iterating the separate analyses.

<p>Example:
<pre>
x := 10;
while (...) {
  if (x == 10) {
    DoSomething();
  } else {
    DoSomethingElse();
    x := x + 1;
  }
}
y := x;
</pre>
If we do constant-propagation analysis and dead-code elimination separately, we will never be able
to simplify this loop. On the other hand, a <em>super-analysis</em> that does the two analyses <em>simultaneously</em> would result in the following optimized code:
<pre>
x := 10;
while (...) {
  DoSomething();
}
y := 10;
</pre>
So, the phase-ordering problem is not simply an ordering problem, but a problem that can get you stuck in a <em>local minimum</em> even if you try all possible orders, as compared to a super-analysis that composes the analyses together.
