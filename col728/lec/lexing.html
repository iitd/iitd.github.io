<h3>Lexical analysis</h3>
<pre>
	if (x == y)
	  z = 1;
	else
	  z = 2;
</pre>

will look like this to the lexical analyzer:

<pre>
\tif (x == y)\n\t  z = 1;\n\telse\n\t  z = 2;\n
</pre>

The lexical analyzer has to put dividers between different units. e.g., a divider between <code>\t</code> and <code>if</code> and <code>&lt;whitespace&gt;</code> and <code>(</code> and so on ...

<h3>Token Class (or Class)</h3>
<ul>
	<li>In English: Noun, Verb, Adjective, ...
	<li>In programming language: Identifier, Keyword, (, ), ...
</ul>

Token classes correspond to sets of strings
<ul>
  <li>Identifier: a string of letters or digits, starting with a letter.
  <li>Integer: a non-empty string of digits
  <li>Keyword: 'if', 'then', 'else', ';', etc.
	<li>Whitespace: a non-empty sequence of blanks, newlines, and tabs
</ul>
Lexical analyzer classifies strings according to role (token class). Communicates tokens to parser.
<pre>
lexer :: string --> [ token ]
token = &lt;class, string&gt;
</pre>
Example input:
<pre>
foo = 42
</pre>
Example output:
<pre>
&lt;Id, "foo"&gt; &lt;Op, "="&gt; &lt;Int, "42"&gt;
</pre>
In our original example
<pre>
\tif (x == y)\n\t  z = 1;\n\telse\n\t  z = 2;\n
</pre>
the relevant token classes are:
<ul>
	<li>Operator
	<li>Whitespace
	<li>Keywords
	<li>Identifiers
	<li>Numbers
	<li>'('
	<li>')'
	<li>';'
	<li>'='
</ul>
Work through the example to show the resulting list of tokens

<p>A lexical analyzer needs to
<ol>
	<li>recognize substrings corresponding to tokens (called <em>lexemes</em>)
	<li>recognize token class of each lexeme to generate &lt;token-class, lexeme&gt;
</ol>

<h3>Lexical analysis examples: Fortran</h3>
In Fortran, whitespace is insignificant:
<pre>
VAR1
</pre>
is exactly the same as
<pre>
VA R1
</pre>
Fortran idea: removing all the whitespace should not change the meaning of the program.

<p>
Loop example
<pre>
DO 5 I = 1,25
</pre>
Here <code>DO</code> is a keyword representing a loop (similar to <code>FOR</code> in C), <code>I = 1,25</code> represents that the iteration variable <code>I</code> ranges from <code>1..25</code>. The number <code>5</code> represents that the loop extends from the <code>DO</code> statement till the statement with label 5, including all statements that are in between.

<p>
Another example:
<pre>
DO 5 I = 1.25
</pre>
The only difference in this code from the previous code is the replacement of <code>,</code> with <code>.</code>.  This simply means that the variable <code>DO5I = 1.25</code>, i.e., a variable has been assigned an integer (there is no loop).

	The problem is that just by looking at the first three characters, I cannot tell whether <code>DO</code> is a keyword or a prefix of a variable name. Hence we need a <em>lookahead</em>. In this example, a large lookahead is required. Ideally, the language design should ensure that the lookahead is small.

<ol>
	<li> Goal: partition the string. Implemented by reading left-to-right, recognizing one token at a time</li>
	<li> <em>Lookahead</em> may be required to decide where one token ends and the next token begins. We would like to minimize lookahead.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Lookahead is always required</h3>
For example, when we read the first character of the keyword <code>else</code>,
we need to lookahead to decide whether it is an identifier or a keyword. Similarly, we need lookahead to disambiguate between <code>==</code> and <code>=</code>.

<p>PL/1: keywords are not reserved.
<pre>
IF ELSE THEN THEN = ELSE; ELSE ELSE = THEN
</pre>
This makes lexical analysis a bit more difficult -- need to decide what is a variable name and what is a keyword, and so need to look at what's going on in the rest of the expression.

<p>
In fact, there are examples where PL/1 may require unbounded lookahead!

<p>Some of these problems exist in languages today: e.g., C++

<p>
C++ template syntax
<pre>
Foo&lt;Bar&gt;
</pre>

C++ stream syntax
<pre>
cin  &gt;&gt; var
</pre>

For a long time, you had to put a blank between two "&gt;" signs in the template syntax. Most C++ compilers have fixed this now.

<p>How much lookahead is required for a language like C?  Depends on the implementation, but one idea that would work well is: look ahead till the next whitespace (outside of quotes).  For example, consider a string constant in C <code>"a" "b"</code>.  Here, the lexer emits two tokens, one for the string constant <code>"a"</code> and another for the string constant <code>"b"</code>; it is left to the parser to interpret these as a single string constant.

<h3>Regular Languages</h3>
Typically, language designers would like to keep lexical analysis as simple as possible. Perhaps the most simple class of languages is <em>Regular Languages</em>. Hence, lexical analysis of most programming languages can be implemented by implementing a classifier for regular languages. Regular languages are the weakest formal languages widely used, and have many applications.

<h3>Regular Expressions</h3>
<pre>
'c' = {"c"}
</pre>

<pre>
\epsilon = {""}
</pre>

Note that \epsilon (a language that has a single element, namely the empty string) is not the same as \phi (empty language).

<p><b>Union</b>: A + B = { a | a in A} U { b | b in B}

<p><b>Concatenation</b>: AB = { ab | a in A and b in B}

<p><b>Iteration (Kleene closure)</b>: A* = A0 + A1 + A2 + ... A\infinity<br>
A0 = \epsilon<br>
Ai = A concatenated with itself i times<br>

<p>Definition: The regular expressions over \Sigma are the smallest set of expressions that includes the following:
<pre>
R =    \epsilon
    |  'c'
    |  R + R
    |  RR
    |  R*
</pre>
This is called the grammar of the regular expressions. We will learn more about grammars when we talk about parsing (not relevant at this stage).

<p>\Sigma = {0, 1}<br>
1* = all strings of 1s
(1 + 0)1 = {11, 01}<br>
0* + 1* = all strings of 0s UNION all strings of 1s
(0 + 1)* = all strings of 0s and 1s (or all strings over the entire alphabet) = \Sigma* (special name for this language)

<p>Many ways of writing any regular language</p>

<p>Regular expressions specify regular languages
<p>Five constructs: Two base cases (\epsilon, single-character strings). Three compound expressions (union, concatenation, iteration)
