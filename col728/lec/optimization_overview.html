<h3>Optimization Overview</h3>
Most complexity in modern compilers is in the optimizer
<ul>
	<li>Also by far, the largest phase in terms of compile-time and in terms of source code size (recall: lexing, parsing, semantic analysis, optimization, code generation)
  <li>Two goals:
	<ul>
		<li>Correctness
		<li>Speed
	</ul>
  </li>
	<li>Complications in code generation from trying to be fast as well as correct
	<li>Over time, fairly elaborate structures have been developed on how to do code generation and runtime structures
</ul>

<p>When should we perform optimizations?
<ul>
	<li>On AST?
		<ul>
			<li>Pro: Machine independent
			<li>Con: Too high level
				<ul>
					<li>Too abstract --- need to have more details to be able to express the "kind" of machine for which the AST needs to be compiled (e.g., register or stack machine or quantum computer)
				</ul>
		</ul>
	<li>On assembly language
		<ul>
			<li>Pro: exposes optimization opportunities
			<li>Con: may be too low level, making optimization difficult (need to undo/redo certain decisions)
			<li>Con: machine dependent
			<li>Con: must reimplement optimizations when retargetting
		</ul>
	<li>On IR
		<ul>
			<li>Pro: can be machine independent, if designed well (can represent a large family of machines)
			<li>Pro: can expose optimization opportunities, if designed well.
		  <li>Con: IR design critical for exposing optimization opportunities.
		</ul>
</ul>

<p>We will be looking at optimizations on an IR which has the following grammar:
<pre>
P --&gt; S P | S
S --&gt; id := id op id
       | id := op id
       | id := id
       | push id
       | id := pop
       | if id relop id goto L
       | L:
       | jump L
</pre>
<ul>
	<li> id's are register names
	<li>constants can replace ids
	<li>typical operators: +, -, *
</ul>

<p>A basic bloack is a maximal sequence of instructions with
<ul>
	<li>no labels (except at the first instruction), and
	<li>no jumps (except in the last instruction)
</ul>

<p>Idea:
<ul>
	<li>Cannot jump into a basic block (except at beginning)
	<li>Cannot jump out of a basic block (except at end)
	<li>A basic block is a single-entry, single-exit, straight-line code segment
</ul>
Once we reach the start of a basic block, we are guaranteed to execute all
instructions in the BB. Furthermore, the only way into the basic block is
through the first statement.

<p>Consider the basic block:
<pre>
1. L:
2.   t := 2*x
3.   w := t + x
4.   if w &gt; 0 goto L'
</pre>
(3) executes only after (2)
<ul>
	<li>We can change (3) to w := 3 * x
		<li> Can we eliminate (2) as well? Need to be sure that <code>t</code> is not used in other basic blocks.
</ul>

<p>A control-flow graph is a directed graph with
<ul>
	<li>Basic blocks as nodes</li>
	<li>An edge from block A to block B if the execution can pass from the last instruction in A to the first instruction in B
		<ul>
			<li>e.g., the last instruction in A is <code>jump Lb</code></li>
			<li>e.g., the last instruction in A is <code>if id relop id then goto Lb</code></li>
			<li>e.g., execution can fall-through from block A to block B</li>
		</ul>
</ul>

<p>Example control-flow graph:
<pre>
BB1:
  x := 1
  i := 1

BB1--&gt;BB2

BB2:
L:
  x := x * x
  i := i + 1
  if i &lt; 10 goto L

BB2 --&gt; BB2

BB2 --&gt; BB3
</pre>


<p>The body of a method (or procedure) can be represented as a control-flow graph. There is one initial node (entry node).  All "return" nodes are terminal.


<p>Optimization seeks to improve a program's resource utilization
<ul>
	<li>Execution time (most often)</li>
	<li>Code size</li>
	<li>Memory usage</li>
	<li>Network messages sent, disk accesses, etc.</li>
	<li>Power consumption</li>
</ul>

<p>Optimization should not alter what the program computes
<ul>
	<li>The answer must still be the same.
</ul>

<p>For languages like C, there are typically three granularities of optimization
<ul>
	<li>Local optimizations
		<ul>
			<li>Apply to a basic block in isolation</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Global optimizations
		<ul>
			<li> Apply to a control-flow graph (method body) in isolation</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Inter-procedural optimizations
		<ul>
			<li>Apply across method boundaries</li>
		</ul>
</ul>

<p>Production compilers do all these types of optimizations.  In general, easies to implement local optimizations and hardest to implement inter-procedural optimizations.

<p>Criteria for evaluating an optimization
<ul>
<li> Payoff.  What is a good payoff? <!-- can talk about the 1% AC efficiency story --> </li>
<li> Frequency of occurrence </li>
<li> Ease of Implementation </li>
<li> Compilation Time </li>
</ul>

<p>In practice, often a conscious decision is made not to implement the fanciest optimization known. Why?
<ul>
	<li>Some optimizations are hard to implement</li>
	<li>Some optimizations are costly in compilation time</li>
	<li>Some optimizations have low payoff. But hard to establish the payoff. Often one optimization may trigger another one, and this is hard to predict in advance.</li>
	<li>Many fancy optimizations are all three!</li>
</ul>

<p>Current state-of-the-art: the goal is "Maximum benefit for minimum cost"
