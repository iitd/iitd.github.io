<strong>Q. No. 1 : What did you like the most about this course?</strong> (Responses: 6)<br><br>1. Details of each part presented well<br>2. The tips and tricks of optimisation <br>3. Programming assignments was the best  Difficult topics were taught with ease  and slowly so that whole class can follow <br>4. Teaching style to the professor and good management of the course <br>5. Teaching and involvememnt of the professor in keeping the class environment alive and drawing students  attention <br>6. optimisation<br> <br><br>

<strong>Q. No. 2 : What did you dislike the most about this course?</strong> (Responses: 5)<br><br>1. A little rushed in the end<br>2. Laborious procedures to some questions <br>3. NA<br>4. It was scheduled at 8 am in the morning <br>5. nothing<br> <br><br>

<strong>Q. No. 3 : Any Suggestions or comments about the course.</strong> (Responses: 5)<br><br>1. More focus on optimisations<br>2. None <br>3.
 A little head start for assignments by explaining things like LLVM 
would have saved some time  One such session was arranged and it did 
prove to be helpful <br>4. More guidance could be given for getting

<strong>Q. No. 1 : What did you like  most about this course?</strong> (Responses: 5)<br><br>1. Actually implementing things makes them clear<br>2. Building a real optimised compiler is a special achievement <br>3. Assignments<br>4. Assignments encouraged us to think critically and creatively <br>5. na<br> <br><br>

<strong>Q. No. 2 : What did you dislike the most about this course?</strong> (Responses: 5)<br><br>1. Little documentation on LLVM<br>2.
 Majority of assignments required us to install and use tools that are 
poorly documented  Installation and usage instructions are much 
appreciated <br>3. NA<br>4. nothing<br>5. na<br> <br><br>

<strong>Q. No. 3 : How effective was the help provided by the teaching assistants?</strong> (Responses: 5)<br><br>1. Good<br>2.
 Some parts are good  construction of AST for ex  but others need to be 
done better  LLVM tutorial would have made job much easier  <br>3. Great  TA was always receptive to the questions outside the classroom <br>4. Very good  The TA was greatly receptive to questions outside the classroom <br>5. na<br> <br><br>

<strong>Q. No. 4 : Were the facilities/equipments adequate for the experiments?</strong> (Responses: 5)<br><br>1. Yes<br>2. Space is my PC was definitely insufficient  Tools required were heavy and required a lot of resources <br>3. NA<br>4. Yes<br>5. na<br> <br><br>

<strong>Q. No. 5 : Any Suggestions or comments about the course</strong> (Responses: 5)<br><br>1. A little documentation on LVM to be provided before labs  to make start easier<br>2.
 Assignments seem harder than they actually are  Students should rather 
focus on algorithm and logic than getting familiar with tools<br>3. Same as above<br>4.
 More guidance could be given for getting started for the assignments  
We had to spend a lot of time for the most basic things initially<br>5. na<br> <br><br>
