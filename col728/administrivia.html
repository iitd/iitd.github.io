<h3>Exams</h3>
All exams will be open-book and open-notes. But no mobile phones and laptops.

<h3>Regrading Policy</h3>
If you are dissatisfied with your grade in any of the
lab-evaluations or exams, you can submit it for "regrading".
You should give us a written
note explaining which question(s) you think were incorrectly evaluated
and why  you think so, along with your corrected manuscript. If we find
merit in your concerns, we will address them. On the other hand, please
remember that we may re-examine the rest of your submission too, and you
some marks may actually get deducted as a result. So please submit
regrading requests only if it is a genuine and a major concern.
Your regrading request for an assignment should be received within
two weeks of the return of answer scripts or assignment grades.

<p>Audit criteria: equivalent to B or above.<br>


<h3>Academic Integrity Code</h3>
<b>Academic honesty is required in all your work</b>. Verbal discussion of
assignments is fine but looking at someone else's work and then doing your is
not. You must do all written and programming assignments on your own, except
where group work is explicitly authorised. If you use parts of a solution or code from
other sources (such as Internet, other OSes, etc.), you should explicitly mention it in your submission. <b>Letting your work become available
  or visible to others is also cheating</b>. The first instance of cheating will
straight-away invite an 'F' grade in the course and a referral to the disciplinary committee.
