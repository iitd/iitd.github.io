  <h2>Due date - 23:55, 26 September 2019</h2>

  <p>The ideas of Chip Multiprocessing(CMP), Symmetric Multiprocessing(SMP) and Simultaneous Multithreading/Hyperthreading (SMT) are 
     discussed in class. Each of these employ different extents of Resource Sharing. In this assignment we will try to observe their 
     comparative imapacts on the peformance of standard applications selected from the SPEC 2017 Benchmarks Suit.</p>

 
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
 
  <ul>
    
    <li> Install SPEC CPU 2017 benchmark suite. (please note that this is an IITD-internal
    link only; this benchmark suite is proprietary so please do not share it outside IIT
    Delhi)
    <ul>
        <li>Download <a href=
        "http://poorvi.cse.iitd.ac.in/~sbansal/isos/cpu2017-1_0_5.iso">http://poorvi.cse.iitd.ac.in/~sbansal/isos/cpu2017-1_0_5.iso</a></li>
      
        <li>Follow instructions at <a href=
        "https://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/install-guide-unix.html">https://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/install-guide-unix.html</a>
        to install and run the CPU 2017 benchmark suite</li>
      
        <li>you can use the commands in this file to run any benchmark
        individually: <a href="cpu2017_cmdlines.sh">cpu2017_cmdlines.sh</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>Run two copies of the same benchmarks on different SMT Cores, different CMP Cores and Different SMP Cores.</a></li>
    
    <li>As a baseline of performance comparison, run the benchmarks in a stand-alone mode, giving them accesses to all the necessary system resources.
        These stand-alone performance values could be used as references to observe how much slowdown each benchmarks experience in each case.</a></li>
    
    <li>Does the types/characteristics of benchmarks have an impact on the performance differences(or, slowdowns)?</a></li>
    
    <li>Do comparative study of performances for the aforementioned four cases with possible explanations.
        Analyze how these slowdowns varies across different benchmarks. If possible, try to argue why does they vary that way.</a></li>

    <li>Your Report should be succinct. It should suitably captures the essence of all your findings.</a></li>
